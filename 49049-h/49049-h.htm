<p class="noi title">THE MOTOR BOYS
UNDER THE SEA</p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>A STRANGE SIGHT</small></h2>


<p>“Look down there! What do you suppose
that is?”</p>

<p>“Must be a whale. See how it’s plowing along
through the waves!”</p>

<p>“And right on top of the water, too. But if
it’s a whale why doesn’t it spout?”</p>

<p>Three boys, who were sailing over the waters
of Massachusetts Bay in a large air craft, had
seen a strange sight as they looked down through
the glass floor of the cabin of their motorship, and
their comments and questions followed rapidly.
So engrossed were they with the appearance of
what seemed to be some marine monster that, for
a few moments, they paid no attention to the
course of their boat, which was carrying them
along just below the clouds.</p>

<p>It was not until Jerry Hopkins, the oldest of
the three lads, called the attention of his companions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
to the need of giving heed to their craft, that
the other two—Ned Slade and Bob Baker—turned
their eyes from the strange creature below
them—if creature it was.</p>

<p>“I say there, Ned!” exclaimed Jerry, “just
throw in a little more gas, will you? or we ourselves
will be down in those same waves in a little
while. We’re sinking!”</p>

<p>“That’s so!” agreed Bob. “But still we
wouldn’t be in much danger, for the automatic air
planes would set when we began to fall too fast.”</p>

<p>“Even at that,” went on Jerry, who was steering
the <i>Comet</i>, as the motorship was named, “even
then I think it’s just as well not to take too many
chances. Turn on a little more gas, Ned.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” exclaimed the one addressed,
and with a quick motion of one of many shining
levers and wheels in the pilot house he sent some
of the compressed gas into the lifting-bags of the
<i>Comet</i>, thus making her more buoyant.</p>

<p>“There it is again!” cried Bob, once more
pointing below. They all looked, Jerry turning
his attention away from the wheel that guided the
craft. First, however, he looked ahead to make
sure there was no danger of a collision, for the
boys had come to Boston to attend an aviation
meet, and at times there had been so many of the
“birdmen” in the sky-space that a collision was
really not so unlikely as at first it would seem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, it’s there yet,” agreed Ned. “I’m sure
it’s a whale!”</p>

<p>“But why doesn’t it spout?” demanded Bob,
who had asked that question before. “Then we’d
be sure of it. I thought whales had to spout
every ten minutes or so, and that one’s been in
sight about that time.”</p>

<p>“You’re off on your natural history, Bob,” said
Jerry, with a smile. “Whales don’t have to spout
oftener than a half-hour. And besides, that’s only
when they’ve been swimming under water. This
one is on the surface, running awash, you might
say, and so doesn’t have to send out a long breath
that it’s been holding in a long while. It can
breathe naturally.”</p>

<p>“That’s it! I’m never right,” grumbled Bob,
whose stout form and good-natured face did not
fit well with the scowl with which he regarded his
chum. “I guess I know as much about whales as
you do, Jerry Hopkins!”</p>

<p>“That isn’t much,” admitted Jerry, frankly.
“I don’t claim to be an authority, but I’m sure a
whale on the surface doesn’t have to spout—at
least, not very often.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure it <em>is</em> a whale?” asked Ned quietly,
and there was something in the tone of his
voice that caused his companions to look quickly
at him. “Why don’t we go lower down so we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
have a better look at it. Then we could make
certain.”</p>

<p>“I guess that would be the best plan,” admitted
Jerry. “We can drop to within a few feet of the
surface and——”</p>

<p>“Don’t go too close!” interrupted Bob. “It
looks to me like a storm. We may get a squall
any minute, and if we go too low down we may not
be able to rise quickly enough. I don’t want to see
the good old <i>Comet</i> come to grief.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” responded Jerry. “But I
guess we’ve done harder stunts than that. Get
ready to let her down, Ned. See if the rudder
planes are all clear.”</p>

<p>“Besides,” went on stout Bob, “we haven’t
had lunch yet, and——”</p>

<p>“There he goes!” cried Ned with a laugh, as
he left his comfortable seat and prepared to go
aft to the motor room. “It wouldn’t be Chunky
unless he mentioned the ‘eats’ every so often. I
was just waiting to hear you come out with that,
Bob.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Well, then, you weren’t disappointed;
were you?” demanded the stout lad.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” interposed Jerry, hastening
to pour oil on troubled waters. “Don’t get
on your ear, Chunky. Ned didn’t mean anything.
Come on, we’ll take a little plane downward, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
settle the identity of this mysterious creature of
the sea.”</p>

<p>“Listen to him!” exclaimed Ned. “He’s getting
poetical!”</p>

<p>“Quit knocking,” advised Jerry. “If Professor
Snodgrass were along now he might be able
to settle the question for us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he’d be sure to want to capture the
beast for his private collection,” said Bob, whose
ill-humor had disappeared, leaving him with a
smile on his round countenance.</p>

<p>“All ready, Ned?” asked Jerry, who was giving
his attention to various gear-wheels and levers.
“Shall I send her down now?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. Just a minute until I open the
gas intake a little wider. You’re going to navigate
as a dirigible; aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“No, I was thinking of sailing as an aeroplane,”
was the answer.</p>

<p>“Oh, then wait until I throw in the rudder
gears.”</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i>, about which I will tell you more
presently (that is, you boys who have had no previous
acquaintance with her), could be navigated
as a dirigible balloon by means of a powerful lifting-gas
stored in reservoirs, or she could sail as
a biplane, her powerful propellers sending her
along on the principle of all “heavier than air”
machines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>While waiting for Ned to adjust the machinery,
so that the change from one form to the other
could be made, Jerry glanced down toward the
heaving waters above which the <i>Comet</i> had been
sailing, and amid the waves of which had appeared
the strange object that had excited the curiosity
of the boys. It was still there, plowing slowly
through the water, but the air craft was so high
up that a good view could not be had of it.</p>

<p>“All ready!” called Ned from the motor room.</p>

<p>Jerry was about to shut off the supply of gas,
sending it into the compressors where it could not
exert a lifting force, and had stretched his hand
toward the lever of the deflecting rudder, when
Bob cried:</p>

<p>“Say, I’ve got an idea! Why didn’t we think
of it before, fellows?”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Jerry, pausing in his intended
operations.</p>

<p>“The telescope,” replied Bob. “We can get
a view of the mysterious beast with that, and won’t
have to go down at all. I’ll get it,” and he started
toward a locker.</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind,” said Jerry. “As long as
we’re ready we might as well go down anyhow.
Besides, only one of us can use the glass at a time.
If we get the <i>Comet</i> near enough we can all see.
Let her go, Ned.”</p>

<p>“Going she is!” came from Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a hissing as the automatic pumps began
compressing the lifting-gas, and a few seconds
later Jerry yanked on the lever that would tilt the
big rudder to such a position that the ship would
dive downward. At the same time the propellers,
which had been revolving slowly, to keep the
<i>Comet</i> from drifting, were whirled with great
rapidity as more power was turned into the motor.
While navigating as a dirigible balloon the propellers
were not needed to keep the ship afloat, but
once the lifting-gas was not used they were vitally
necessary, for only by keeping in motion can a
“heavier than air” machine be prevented from
falling.</p>

<p>Bob, who was looking through the glass floor
in the main cabin, tracing the course of the object
that had so excited the boys, suddenly looked
up at Jerry.</p>

<p>“Something’s wrong!” cried the fat lad, and
by his tones it could easily be told that he referred
to the motorship, and not to the object below him
in the water.</p>

<p>“I should say there was!” gasped Jerry, for
the <i>Comet</i> had plunged downward with such
abruptness that the boys were fairly dizzy.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” yelled Ned, making his
way from the motor room by fairly pulling himself
along. He had to do this as the ship was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
tilted at such a sharp angle. “What happened?”
Ned went on.</p>

<p>“It’s that deflecting rudder again!” answered
Jerry. “I thought we had it adjusted too fine.
Now it’s jammed again.”</p>

<p>“Shut off the motors! Stop the propellers!”
cried Bob.</p>

<p>“I’m doing it as fast as I can!” returned tall
Jerry. He had reached over and snapped off a
switch that controlled the electric current which
fired the gasoline motor.</p>

<p>“We’re heading straight into the sea—bow
down!” cried Ned, taking a hasty observation.</p>

<p>“Turn on the gas again!” ordered Jerry.
“That’s the only thing that will stop us now!
And do it quick, too! I’ll have a new rudder if
we ever get out of this alive!”</p>

<p>Ned, with desperate haste, was opening the gas
valves. With an angry hiss the vapor rushed
from the condensers it had so recently entered, and
began filling the lifting-bags. Still the <i>Comet</i>
plunged down toward the ocean, in which could
still be seen that strange creature. It was circling
about now, as though waiting for the destruction
of the motorship.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>A STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE</small></h2>


<p>“Jerry, we’ve got to do something!” cried
Ned.</p>

<p>“And do it quick!” added Bob.</p>

<p>“We’re doing all we can,” responded the tall
youth in tense tones. In all the excitement he remained
calmer than did his chums, and calmness
was a necessary virtue in this emergency. Jerry
Hopkins had that one happy faculty of seldom
“losing his head.”</p>

<p>Now he was striving desperately, however, in
spite of his seeming calm, to prevent the accident
which seemed so imminent. And his companions,
catching something of his cool self-control, restrained
their own excitement and came to Jerry’s
aid.</p>

<p>And while strenuous efforts are thus being
made to save the <i>Comet</i> from plunging into the
sea, I will beg the indulgence of my old readers
for a few moments while I describe, for the benefit
of my new ones, something about the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
chums and their various activities as set forth in
the previous books of this series.</p>

<p>As might be guessed the lads were called the
“Motor Boys” for obvious reasons. They were
always seen on some form of motor, beginning
with a bicycle (which in a way is a motor vehicle)
and ending with an airship. No, not ending, for
the activities of the motor boys are far from ended,
I hope.</p>

<p>To describe the boys themselves I will say that
Bob Baker was the son of a wealthy banker, while
Ned’s father, Aaron Slade, kept a large department
store in which Mr. Baker was also interested.
The father of Jerry Hopkins was dead,
but his mother had been left comfortably off, and
by means of wise investments, recommended by
Mr. Baker, had managed to accumulate a small
fortune. It will thus be seen that my three heroes
were well supplied with money to carry out their
ideas of sport in motor vehicles. And they did
not depend on their parents for all their funds.
The boys were part owners of a valuable gold
mine, and they received profits from it.</p>

<p>They lived in the New England town of Cresville,
not far from Boston, and were well known
in the country roundabout, for they made trips far
and near. Often on these trips they had unpleasant
experiences with Noddy Nixon, a sort of town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
bully, and his crony, Bill Berry, as well as with
Jack Pender, with whom Noddy chummed.</p>

<p>The first book of this series is entitled “The
Motor Boys,” and in it is described how our
heroes took part in some bicycle races, and eventually
obtained motorcycles for themselves, on
which they had a number of adventures.</p>

<p>In a later race they won an auto as a prize, and
one of their activities was to take a trip overland.
Their companion on this, as well as on other journeys,
was a certain Professor Uriah Snodgrass,
who was an enthusiastic collector of rare specimens
of the animal kingdom, from black fleas to
luminous snakes. The professor was an odd character,
as you will doubtless soon discover.</p>

<p>After an exciting tour the boys went to Mexico,
and, coming back from there, they were instrumental
in locating the hermit of Lost Lake.</p>

<p>In the fifth book of the series, entitled “The
Motor Boys Afloat,” I related what happened
when Jerry, Ned and Bob got a motor boat. They
had surprising adventures in their voyage on the
Atlantic, later in the strange waters of the Florida
Everglades, and then on the Pacific.</p>

<p>Naturally, with the gradual perfecting of air
craft, the boys turned their thoughts to them, and
in the volume called “The Motor Boys in the
Clouds,” I had the pleasure of telling you of their
adventures above the earth. They had a long trip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
which ended in both fame and fortune, and in going
over the Rockies they solved a mystery of the
air, later effecting a rescue near the clouds, over
the ocean.</p>

<p>Again they were on the wing, and learning of
a strange treasure they went in search of it. In
the book that immediately preceded this one,
called “The Motor Boys on the Border,” I told
how the boys, returning from the Grand Canyon
of the Colorado, found new opportunities awaiting
them. This was to undertake a search for
sixty nuggets of gold that had been secreted by an
old prospector when he had to flee from his enemies.
He had hidden them in a deep valley, near
the border between Montana and Canada, and
sought the aid of the boys and their airship to recover
them.</p>

<p>How the sixty nuggets were found, how the
enemies were outwitted, and how Professor Snodgrass
located his luminous snakes—all this you will
find set down in the book.</p>

<p>After these adventures the boys returned home,
and to while away the time they had again put in
commission their motorship <i>Comet</i> and gone to
the Boston aviation meet. They had taken some
part in it, winning two prizes for all-around efficiency.</p>

<p>Perhaps my new readers will like a brief
description of the <i>Comet</i>. It was a craft built for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
comfort, and for long trips rather than for speed,
though it could skim along very fast when necessary.
The motorship was, as its name indicates,
a veritable ship, and the addition of hydroplanes
enabled it to navigate on the water as well as in
the air. Wheels could be attached, if desired, so
that it could also move along on smooth ground,
but this was seldom done, and no great speed was
attained that way.</p>

<p>As I have said the <i>Comet</i> could be used either
as a biplane, or as a dirigible balloon. There was
considerable machinery aboard it—motors, dynamos,
gas-producing apparatus; and on board the
boys and their friends could live comfortably for
many days without descending.</p>

<p>There was a main cabin, sleeping berths, the
motor room, where most of the machinery was
installed, and a pilot house that contained the
guiding levers and wheels. The bottom of part
of the craft contained heavy plate glass, so observations
of the earth could be made through it.</p>

<p>And I must not forget the kitchen and dining
room. These places were the especial delight of
Bob Baker, for I think I have already indicated
that “Chunky,” as Bob was often called, because
of his short and plump conformation, was very
fond of eating. His chums joked him about it,
but he seldom minded that.</p>

<p>And it was in the <i>Comet</i> that our heroes now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
were, having decided to navigate for a while over
the sea after witnessing some sensational flights
at the aviation grounds outside of Boston. And
it was also in the <i>Comet</i> that danger had now come
to the boys as they sought to descend to get a
nearer view of what they thought might be a great
whale, but which did not act as a whale should.</p>

<p>“How about it, Jerry? Are we gaining any?”
cried Ned, as he stood beside the gas machine,
trying to hasten the filling of the lifting-bags.</p>

<p>“I think so,” was the answer. Jerry never
took his eyes from the pressure gage that told how
much gas was being forced out from the containers.</p>

<p>“But we’re still going down!” cried Bob, who
was looking at the height-indicator. “And going
down fast, too! We’re only five hundred feet up
now!”</p>

<p>“I know it, Chunky,” said Jerry, still quietly.
“We are doing all we can. Even if we do
hit the water you know we still have the hydroplanes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t a question of actually sinking,”
called Ned, as he opened the gas valve to the
limit. “We’d probably float safely enough, but
we’re going down so fast that if we hit at this
speed, we’ll be sure to rip the planes off, and do
no end of other damage to our boat!”</p>

<p>“That’s the point,” agreed Jerry. “It’s only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the speed at which we are falling that I’m afraid
of. Ordinarily we could volplane down and take
the water easily enough, but the jamming of that
deflecting rudder came so suddenly that we
couldn’t get in position to make a good descent.”</p>

<p>“We’re on a more even keel now,” observed
Ned, as he looked at the indicating pendulum.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Bob, “and we’re going slower,
too. We’ve got three hundred feet more, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Then we can do it, fellows! I guess we’re all
right now. Is all the gas out, Ned?”</p>

<p>“About all, yes.”</p>

<p>“And just in time,” murmured the stout lad,
his eyes again seeking the height indicator. “Two
hundred feet is a pretty close call, as fast as we
were falling. We’ve almost stopped now, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. We won’t lose any time putting
on a new kind of rudder, either. I’ve had it in
mind a good while to change ours. I wish I hadn’t
delayed so long.”</p>

<p>A moment later the motorship ceased her descent,
and was floating on an even keel, a short
distance above the rolling waves, blown gently
along by the wind, for her propellers were not revolving.</p>

<p>“Well, we may as well start again, and make
for shore as a dirigible balloon,” said Jerry, after
a little pause, in which they all breathed more freely.
It had been an exciting time for them, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
they had met the emergency bravely, and with the
grit and spunk of true American youths.</p>

<p>“I wonder what has become of the cause of all
our trouble?” ventured Ned. “I haven’t thought
to look for that whale. Let’s take a peep, fellows.”</p>

<p>Before starting the propellers the boys went out
on the partially enclosed deck and looked about
them. At first they did not see the strange object
that had attracted their attention. Then, as he
gazed to the North, Bob cried:</p>

<p>“There she is—and, fellows, as I’m alive it
isn’t a whale at all! Look! It’s a submarine!
See the men on her decks! They’re looking at
us!”</p>

<p>With gasps of astonishment, Ned and Jerry
turned toward where Bob pointed.</p>

<p>There, lazily rolling with the action of the
waves, was indeed a large submarine boat, of the
latest type, as the boys could see, for they were
well up on naval matters. The half-rounded deck,
the sides and blunt stern and bow of the strange
craft glistened from the water that had splashed
over her, or perhaps it was wet from just having
dived, and come to the surface again.</p>

<p>And, as Bob had said, there were several men
on the low deck, that was almost awash. They
looked curiously at our heroes. The men appeared
to be mechanics, for their clothes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
rough and grease-covered. But then, in a submarine,
even the officers get that way, for the
quarters are very cramped.</p>

<p>“That’s a foreign submarine!” exclaimed Ned,
suddenly.</p>

<p>“How do you know?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Because I can tell by her build, and by the
look of the men. That’s a foreign submarine, and
I shouldn’t be surprised if she was the one——”</p>

<p>Ned stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>“What is it? Why don’t you go on?” asked
Jerry, turning to his chum.</p>

<p>“Because I think they can hear us. Sound carries
very clearly over water, you know. I’ll tell
you later, and——”</p>

<p>“There comes another man on deck!” interrupted
Bob. The men on top of the submarine
turned their gaze away from the airship as someone,
evidently their superior officer, appeared
among them, coming up by the deck hatch. They
saluted him, and pointed toward the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>Instantly the newcomer turned. The boys
could see that he was a large man, with a stern and
forbidding face, and his hair and beard were snow-white.</p>

<p>He started as he beheld the craft of our heroes,
and evidently gave a command, for the others at
once left the deck of the submarine. Then, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
a last look at the <i>Comet</i>, the aged commander
hurried down through the deck hatch. There was
a rattle of metal as the cover was clapped into
place, and a second later the submarine disappeared
beneath the waters of the bay.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>THROUGH THE STORM</small></h2>


<p>“What do you know about that?” cried Ned,
looking at his wondering companions.</p>

<p>“That sure was a sudden dive,” agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>“They must have their machinery under pretty
good control, and be able to work it quickly,”
came from Bob. “Why, that old gentleman
wasn’t down inside that hatch more than a quarter
of a minute before the whole thing was under
water. The hatch must have closed automatically
when he went down it.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s it,” said Jerry. “You can’t see
so much as a bubble of her now.”</p>

<p>The boys gazed at the surface of the sea. The
heaving and rolling waves were all that was visible.</p>

<p>“She must have gone down deep,” observed
Ned. “You couldn’t even see her periscopes.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t have any,” asserted Jerry. “If she
had they would have stuck up for a second or two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
for usually they’re about twenty feet above the
deck. She doesn’t use periscopes, that’s evident.”</p>

<p>“What are periscopes?” asked Bob, who usually
didn’t take such an interest in mechanics as
did his chums. When taunted with this Bob used
to say it kept him so busy cooking for Ned and
Jerry that he had no time to brush up on the latest
inventions.</p>

<p>“Periscopes are the eyes of a submarine, when
it is running in about twenty feet of water,” explained
Jerry. “I mean at that depth below the
surface. They are hollow tubes, and are just
above the surface when the boat is down about
twenty feet. They run through the deck, and into
the pilot house. By looking into the lower end
of them the observer can get a view all around
him at the surface.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how,” spoke the stout lad.</p>

<p>“It is done by means of reflecting mirrors,
lenses and prisms,” Ned put in. “I looked through
one once on a submarine that was being built. It’s
great. It beats a telescope all to pieces. A telescope,
you know, means an instrument by which
you can see far off—‘tele,’ meaning afar, and
‘scope’ to look—Latin or Greek words, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Say, is this a recitation?” asked Bob, with a
smile.</p>

<p>“No, I’m just explaining,” answered Ned.
“Periscope is made up in the same way, from Latin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
or Greek words, and it literally means to ‘look
all around’.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Jerry. “But even looking
all around doesn’t seem to show that submarine.
It has completely disappeared. And I’d have
given a good deal to have a good look at her.”</p>

<p>“So would I,” spoke Ned. “I’d like to have
gone aboard.”</p>

<p>“You would!” cried Bob. “Would you go
under in her?”</p>

<p>“I would—yes, if I had the chance,” replied
Ned. “But I’d prefer one of our own United
States boats to that foreign one. I didn’t like the
looks of that man with the white beard, and if
what I read is true——”</p>

<p>“Say, what was that you started to say?” interrupted
Jerry. “You were on the point of remarking
it when the craft went to the bottom.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was,” admitted Ned. “I saw something
in the papers not long ago—it was a foreign
dispatch, I think—to the effect that a German had
perfected a most wonderful and dangerous submarine.
It had motors operated by a new electrical
chemical, that could be stored in a small
space, and the article intimated that the submarine
could even cross the ocean.”</p>

<p>“Of course that’s remarkable, in a way,” admitted
Jerry, “but you seemed to have something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
else on your mind. What was it? Loosen up,
Ned.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s no great secret. I didn’t just want
those fellows on the submarine to hear me; that’s
all. But this article went on to say that the inventor
was a sort of crank, with a very vindictive
disposition, and that he imagined all other nations
were the enemy of Germany. He seemed to think
that if the German war officials took a sufficient
number of his submarines the Kaiser would be
Lord of the Sea, and could wipe everything else
out of existence. That’s one reason I wouldn’t
care to go aboard that boat.”</p>

<p>“That is, if it’s the same one,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” assented Ned. “Of course it’s only
a notion of mine that this craft may be the product
of the brain of that eccentric German. But he
looked like a foreigner, and the way he seemed to
get excited when he saw us—acting as though he
feared we were spying on him—made me a bit
suspicious.”</p>

<p>“But what does he want over here, in American
waters?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s the point,” responded Ned. “What’s
his game—if it is he? But we don’t have to worry
about it, I guess.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” spoke Bob, and his
tones were serious. “If he’s going to scoot about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
under water, practicing evolutions for destroying
our ships, it may mean trouble for us.”</p>

<p>“For us?” repeated Jerry, looking at his fat
chum curiously. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly trouble for <em>you</em> fellows,”
explained Bob, “but for my family. Of course
it’s quite remote, but it might happen. My Uncle
Nelson Sheldon, and his daughter Grace, are on
their way to this country from Germany. They
are coming in a small steamer, and my uncle is
bringing something very valuable with him. That
is, valuable to our family.”</p>

<p>“If it was something valuable for <em>you</em> I suppose
it would be a full course dinner; eh, Chunky?”
asked Ned with a chuckle.</p>

<p>“Oh, let up; can’t you?” begged the stout lad.
“It isn’t anything to eat, I’m sure of that, though
I’m hungry enough now. I don’t know just what
it is, but I overheard father and mother talking
about it. It’s something that Uncle Nelson has
been on the lookout for a good many years, and
at last he found it in Germany.”</p>

<p>“In Germany!” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, and that’s what made me speak as I did
when I heard what Ned remarked,” went on the
fat youth. “If that’s a crazy German in a submarine
he may hit the boat my uncle is on.”</p>

<p>“Say, this is getting mysterious, all right,”
spoke Ned. “Not that I think there’s the slightest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
danger though, Bob. Your uncle has a million
chances to one in his favor. What steamer is he
and his daughter on?”</p>

<p>“The <i>Hassen</i>. It’s a German boat. He said
he took that to avoid the crowds. He’s due to
land in a few days, I believe, and then I’ll know
what it is he’s bringing over that’s so valuable.”</p>

<p>“How about his daughter?” asked Ned.
“Have we ever seen her, Chunky?”</p>

<p>“No, and I believe she’s considered a very
pretty girl, too,” spoke the stout youth.</p>

<p>“Then you’ve got to introduce us to her as soon
as she lands, my boy!” stipulated Jerry. “Pretty
girls are too scarce to miss.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll meet her,” said Bob. “I’ve told
her about you fellows, and she wants to know
you.”</p>

<p>“Good for her!” cried Ned. “Well, we seem
to have run into a complication of matters just
through sighting that submarine. That’s out of
sight, of course, but there’s still your uncle, his
pretty daughter, and the mysterious thing he’s
bringing over, Bob. It gives us something to look
forward to, at any rate.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we’re going to have something else
to look forward to, and that right soon,” spoke
Jerry, suddenly.</p>

<p>“What is it?” inquired Bob, looking about.
“Is that submarine in sight again?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, but we’re going to have a storm, if I’m
any judge, and pretty quickly, too. We’re quite
a few miles out to sea, and we’d better run to
shore, I think.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” agreed Bob. “But say, what
about grub? I can get it while you and Ned manage
the <i>Comet</i>.”</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha!” laughed Jerry. “I was waiting
for you to say that, Chunky. But there—don’t
get riled! Of course you can get up a meal. But
let it be a simple one, for we may be in the midst
of a blow any minute. And we’ll need your help,
now that part of our gear is out of order. So
don’t fuss too much, Chunky.”</p>

<p>“I won’t. But I’m awful hungry!”</p>

<p>“Just to show that there are no hard feelings
I could eat a bit myself,” added Ned. “Go to it,
Bob, my boy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we’ll have to get busy ourselves,
Ned,” spoke Jerry. “We’d better make everything
as snug as we can, and then go up. We may
get above the storm centre, but I doubt it. It
looks as though it was going to be pretty general.”</p>

<p>The weather had indeed changed suddenly.
Gray banks of clouds, fringed with ominous black,
hung low on the horizon, while above the sky was
a coppery-yellowish cast that seemed to indicate
the coming of a great wind.</p>

<p>The sea, too, was heaving restlessly, as if anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to join in the revel of the elements, and there
was a low moaning sound that told of the howling
gale to come.</p>

<p>But just at present it was calm enough—the
threatening calm before the storm—and Jerry
was about to take advantage of it to start toward
land.</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> was still hovering over the spot
where the submarine had disappeared. The
motorship was moving slowly, her propellers barely
revolving enough to give her steerage-way.</p>

<p>Jerry, with one last look at the surface of the
sea, to discern, if possible, whether the strange
boat had come to the top again, set about making
all snug in preparation for the battle with the
elements.</p>

<p>This was soon done, and while Bob was busy in
the small galley, getting ready a meal, Ned and
Jerry started the boat. The big propellers beat
the air fiercely, and, as a dirigible balloon, the
<i>Comet</i> darted high above the restless sea, and
toward the shores of Boston Harbor, now many
miles from sight.</p>

<p>But the craft was not to reach a safe haven
without a fight. Scarce two miles had been covered
before the storm broke, its fury increasing
every minute.</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> heeled over until, had she been a
water ship, she would have been on her beam ends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Jerry and his chums had to grasp supports to
avoid falling.</p>

<p>“Throw in the automatic gyroscope balancer!”
yelled the tall lad to Ned. “We’ll turn turtle in
a minute if you don’t!”</p>

<p>“In she goes!” cried Ned, springing for the
motor room.</p>

<p>The gale howled about them. Below the waves
were whipped into sudden foam, and they tossed
themselves on high as though reaching for the
<i>Comet</i>, which rushed on through the storm like
a frightened bird.</p>

<p>“Some blow!” panted Bob, as he jumped aside
in time to avoid the contents of the scalding hot
coffee pot on the galley stove. “Some blow!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it’s getting worse every minute!”
Jerry cried.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>A NEW QUEST</small></h2>


<p>Fortunately for our heroes the <i>Comet</i> was
a staunch craft, even though built to navigate the
air, and, like others of her kind, light in construction.
But the motorship had passed safely
through hard blows before, and Jerry and his
chums hoped this would be no exception. Also
the boys, when the first warnings of the blow were
observed, had made everything as snug as possible.
Now all they could do was to remain in shelter
and navigate their craft as best they might.</p>

<p>And glad indeed were they of shelter, too, for,
after the first fury of the blast had whipped the
sea into foam, there came a burst of rain, almost
tropical in its volume.</p>

<p>“I should say it <em>was</em> a blow!” gasped Bob, as
he righted the coffee pot. “Look at that!” he
cried. “All wasted!”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that,” advised Jerry, who
was having all he could do to hold to the steering
wheel, which was twisting and turning in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
hands as the wind forced the big rudder this way
and that. “We’re lucky to be as right as we are,
so say nothing about losing a little coffee.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m hungry!” exclaimed the stout lad
who, it seemed, would not be balked of his meal,
even in a bad storm. “I’m going to make some
more,” he went on. “That is, unless you need me
here, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“No,” panted the tall steersman. “I guess
Ned and I can manage things for a while, unless
something happens. We’re going up fairly well,
and perhaps we can get above the storm.”</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> was now under better control, and
was steadily mounting under the influence of the
powerful lifting-gas, and the push of her propellers,
the elevating rudder being tilted in the proper
direction. Of course she was also headed toward
the shore in order to take her from above the dangerous
water, but her progress in that direction
was not as rapid as it would have been had it not
been necessary to mount in an endeavor to rise
above the gale. At least, that was what Jerry was
trying to do.</p>

<p>Of course the craft, as I have said, was built to
navigate on the water by means of pontoons or
hydroplanes, but this could be done only on comparatively
calm surfaces. With the sea boiling
and seething as it now was, the <i>Comet</i> would have
been wrecked had she fallen into it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“I almost wish we were in that submarine,” said
Ned, as he came to stand near Jerry, to aid him if
necessary.</p>

<p>“Why?” called Bob from the little galley.</p>

<p>“Because then we wouldn’t mind the storm, no
matter how hard it blew. Don’t you remember
reading that a comparatively short distance below
the surface the effect of a storm is not felt? Those
fellows can sail along, deep down under the ocean,
and not even know a blow is going on up above.”</p>

<p>“Well, they may be safer than we are,” exclaimed
Bob, as he put on another pot of coffee,
taking care to secure it to the electric stove so it
would not spill off, “but, all the same, I don’t go
in much for submarines. They’re too likely not
to come to the top when you want them to.”</p>

<p>“Not the newest models,” defended Ned, who
seemed to have taken a sudden interest in the
under-water boats. “They rarely have an accident
now-a-days. I’d like to take a chance in one.”</p>

<p>“I think I would too,” spoke Jerry, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well, if you fellows go, of course I’m not going
to back out,” asserted Bob, who, to do him
credit, was as full of grit, when the test came, as
either of his chums.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know that there is any likelihood
of our navigating one,” went on Jerry. “Still,
you never can tell. It’s about the only kind of
locomotion we haven’t tried yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I only hope one thing,” spoke Bob, as
he began to make some sandwiches for himself
and his chums, “and that is that this submarine
doesn’t try to blow up, or sink, the <i>Hassen</i> with
my uncle and cousin on board.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! There’s about as much danger of
that happening as there is of the moon falling on
us,” said Jerry, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“I guess Bob means he doesn’t want the submarine
to tackle that ship his uncle is on until he
finds out what it is that his respected relative is
bringing over,” spoke Ned.</p>

<p>“Or until he introduces us to his pretty cousin,”
added Jerry with a smile. “Eh, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you fellows make me tired. Here, take
some of this grub. I’m hungry.”</p>

<p>“Your usual state,” commented Ned, drily.</p>

<p>Perhaps my new readers may think it strange
that the boys could talk thus lightly while trying
to escape from a bad storm in an airship, but my
old friends will understand of what sort of material
Bob, Ned and Jerry were made. They were
used to danger—not that they courted it, but
when it came they could meet it face to face, and
they seldom allowed it to get on their nerves. And
their talk, in this case, was calculated to restore
their own confidence for, in a measure, it took
their attention from the fury of the elements.</p>

<p>And there was fury and to spare. The wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
seemed to increase in violence every moment, and
the rain, beating on the roof of the cabin, almost
drowned the sound of their voices, and hushed the
hum of the machinery and the whine of the dynamos.</p>

<p>It was fortunate, in a way, that the craft was
not manœuvering as an aeroplane, for the broad
expanse of the wing and rudder planes would have
offered so much resistance to the wind that the
<i>Comet</i> might have turned turtle. As it was, some
of the planes had been folded back out of the way.
This was a new improvement in the boys’ craft,
and one that enabled it to be used to better advantage
as a dirigible balloon.</p>

<p>True it was that the expanse of the gas-bags
offered a large surface to the gale, but this could
not be avoided. It was absolutely necessary to
have them filled, or the ship would have plunged
into the sea.</p>

<p>Jerry was operating to the limit the motor
which whirled the great propellers, and all the
force at his command was needed to make headway
against the wind. The <i>Comet</i> was shooting
almost into the teeth of it, which was to her disadvantage.</p>

<p>Holding with one hand each to the steering
wheel, Jerry and Ned ate their sandwiches and
drank their coffee. The last was not easy as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
motorship plunged and swayed, spilling part of
the beverage.</p>

<p>“But it’s fine—what I can get of it,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s right—and the sandwiches are bully!”
exclaimed Ned. “You’re all to the mustard,
Bob!”</p>

<p>“Glad you like them,” responded the stout
youth, evidently well pleased.</p>

<p>There came a sudden burst of fury in the gale,
and the craft seemed to plunge downward.</p>

<p>“Look out!” cried Ned, glancing toward the
glass floor in the pilot house, through which he
could see the crests of the angry waves. “Look
out, Jerry!”</p>

<p>The tall lad gave a twist to the elevating rudder,
which overcame the downward tendency, and
once more the <i>Comet</i> was moving upward. The
rain still fell, the wind howled and roared and the
lightning now began to play about the ship, while
the thunder rolled almost incessantly. But the gallant
craft held on in spite of all.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a sharp, breaking sound,
accompanying a brilliant pinkish flash of light, and
then came an awful roar. For a moment the boys
were almost paralyzed, and they felt a tingling
as of pins and needles all over their bodies. Their
ear drums seemed burst.</p>

<p>“That bolt passed close to us!” yelled Ned,
above the thunder-echoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should say so,” agreed Jerry. “A little bit
more and it would have struck us. Smell the sulphur!”</p>

<p>A pronounced odor was noticeable in the cabin.</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Bob, “it put the small dynamo
out of business, too. It short-circuited it!”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” cried Jerry, looking at one of
the pieces of apparatus used for generating the
powerful lifting-gas. “But we won’t need that
now, I guess. We ought to be over land pretty
soon and able to make a landing.”</p>

<p>“We can’t in this wind,” said Bob, who went
over to make a close inspection of the damaged
dynamo. “We’d be blown into a tree or house,
and smashed.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to try to get out of the path of the
storm,” said Jerry, who well understood the danger
of going down to earth in this gale. “I think
its path is comparatively narrow. Is she much
damaged, Bob?” referring to the dynamo.</p>

<p>“No, those new fuses you put in saved her. It
just burned out a couple of them. I can connect
it up if you say so. We might need it in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“No, we have some gas in the reserve tank yet,
and there is no use taking chances monkeying
around a dynamo in a thunder-storm. Come away
from it!”</p>

<p>That one terrific stroke, which had come so
near to the motorship, seemed to have broken the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
backbone of the storm, in a measure, and there
was a noticeable diminution in the force of the
wind, while the rain fell less heavily.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon, and night was coming on,
so with the clouds to add to the gloom of the sky,
it was so dark that the boys could hardly see the
water below them.</p>

<p>A little later, when the storm showed more evidence
of dying out, they looked down and saw
below them the lights of Boston.</p>

<p>“We’re safe!” cried Jerry. “The bay isn’t
under us any more.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Bob. “Now we can have a
regular supper!”</p>

<p>“You sure are the limit, Chunky!” cried Ned.
“But never mind. We won’t rub it in. This has
been a strenuous afternoon, all right, from the
time we sighted that submarine.”</p>

<p>“I wonder where it is now?” asked Bob, and
his chums could see that he really was worrying
over the safety of his uncle and cousin.</p>

<p>“No telling,” said Jerry. “I don’t believe we
will ever see her again.”</p>

<p>Neither he nor his chums realized what fate
had in store for them in connection with that same
submarine.</p>

<p>Jerry knew the course he wished to take, though
it was necessary to steer by compass, and soon,
when the storm had quieted down to only a comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
gentle blow, the tall steersman guided
his craft to the ground in a big open field, some
miles from Boston. There it was anchored for
the night and the boys prepared to stay on board,
as they had often done before. They had come
down in a lonely neighborhood, so they were not
troubled by curious spectators.</p>

<p>In the morning scarcely a trace of the storm
was to be seen.</p>

<p>The boys made some necessary repairs, fixing
the refractory rudder so that it could be used
temporarily.</p>

<p>“And then I’m done with it,” said Jerry, firmly.
“I’m going to attach an entirely different
kind.”</p>

<p>Again the <i>Comet</i> soared into the air, and this
time her blunt nose was pointed toward Cresville,
which the boys reached in record time, no happenings
worthy of note occurring on the way.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad you boys are home!” exclaimed
Mrs. Hopkins, as the airship landed near
Jerry’s house. “We were just beginning to get
anxious about you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re all right, Mother!” exclaimed the
tall lad, as he kissed her. “Had a little blow,
that’s all.” He seldom told of the dangers through
which he and his chums passed.</p>

<p>“There’s someone here to see you,” went on
Mrs. Hopkins, with a smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is it Bob’s uncle?” asked Ned, with a laugh.</p>

<p>At that moment a voice was heard coming from
the house. It said:</p>

<p>“One moment now, Susan! Don’t move. Stand
very still!”</p>

<p>“What for? Am I going to have my picture
took?” asked a voice Jerry recognized as that
of his mother’s maid.</p>

<p>“No, I am not going to photograph you,” was
the answer. “But there is a very rare specimen
of a blue lady-bug on your left shoulder and I
want to get it for——”</p>

<p>“A bug! The saints preserve me! Take it
off quick!” cried Susan.</p>

<p>“One moment! There, I have it!” was exclaimed
triumphantly, and the boys, with one accord,
as they looked at each other cried out:</p>

<p>“Professor Snodgrass!”</p>

<p>It was indeed he, and a moment later the jolly
little bald-headed scientist stepped to the door,
holding tightly in one hand the new bug he had
captured.</p>

<p>“Ah, good morning, boys!” he exclaimed.
“Well, you see I came here again, and this time I
think you’ll agree that I have a difficult quest under
way.”</p>

<p>“Is it to get more luminous snakes?” asked
Jerry, as he and his chums shook hands with the
professor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, though that commission was hard enough.
This time I have an order from the Boston museum
to get a specimen—three or four, if I can—of
the hermit crab, the <i>Pagurus</i>, or <i>Eupagurus
Bernhardus</i>. And to do this I shall have to search
on the bottom of the sea. So if you have a submarine
boat anywhere around, boys, I’d like to
use her, for I must get that specimen!”</p>

<p>Jerry, Ned and Bob looked at one another. The
professor’s words stirred strange recollections.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>A FEARFUL GALE</small></h2>


<p>“Well, boys, you seem to think there is something
strange in my new quest,” remarked Professor
Snodgrass, looking from one to the other
of the motor boys. “Don’t you care to go off on
expeditions with me any more? I know you used
to be fond of traveling. And now, when I come
to you with this proposition, you seem to think
it is too much.</p>

<p>“As soon as I received the commission to get
a hermit crab—one that lives in the shell of some
mollusk—I thought of you boys. I said to myself
that you were not afraid to sail through the air,
so naturally you wouldn’t back out when it came to
going under water. And now——”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that, Professor,” interrupted Jerry, respectfully.
“It’s just the suddenness of it, and a
peculiar coincidence. We haven’t thought much
about a submarine, though I’m sure we could manage
one if we tried. It’s just a certain happening
that occurred yesterday that made us seem so surprised.
We’ll tell you all about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“One moment!” exclaimed Mrs. Hopkins. “I
didn’t object very much, Jerry, when you wanted
to take up aeroplaning, though I was very anxious.
But I am afraid I must draw the line at submarines.
I am <em>so</em> afraid of them. Professor
Snodgrass, if I had known this was the nature of
your new quest, I’d never have let you mention it
to the boys,” and she playfully shook her finger
at him.</p>

<p>“There will be no danger—no danger in the
least, I assure you, Mrs. Hopkins,” said the little
scientist, with an old-fashioned bow. “I know
the boys are brave and if we do go to the bottom
of the sea in a submarine we will come back safely.
Don’t worry.”</p>

<p>“I just can’t help it,” Mrs. Hopkins rejoined.
“But I feel sure that it will be a long time before
the boys will be able to build a submarine and go
down in it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” answered Jerry, with
a smile. “But, Professor, let us tell you how
strangely your quest fits in with a little experience
we passed through yesterday.”</p>

<p>Then, by turns, each adding something, the boys
told of the sight of the submarine, and of the
storm through which they had passed.</p>

<p>“Hum! Yes,” said Mr. Snodgrass, when Ned
had spoken of reading about the German boat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
“I also recollect that. The man’s name is Klauss,
I believe.”</p>

<p>“And is his boat really so wonderful?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, from the brief accounts I saw of it I
should say it was the last word in submarines,”
replied the scientist. “I wish I had an opportunity
to examine it, and if it is in this country, which
seems to be the case, we may get a chance.”</p>

<p>“Not if he acts the way he did when we saw
him,” commented Jerry. “He didn’t seem to
want to be interviewed, and dived down as soon
as he could.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, maybe he was afraid of the coming
storm,” went of Mr. Snodgrass. “Even the best
submarine can’t stand being filled with water, you
know, and they have very little free-board when
running awash. However, let us now consider
this new quest of mine. I really must make an attempt
to get some of these rare hermit crabs, and
the only way I know how to do it is to get to the
bottom of the sea in a submarine. If you boys
have no idea of making one perhaps I can get
someone else. But I would rather go with you.”</p>

<p>“And I think we’d like to go!” cried Jerry,
looking about to make sure his mother did not
hear him. He knew she would let him go when
the time came, after she had been assured of the
comparative safety of the cruise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then it’s all settled!” cried the professor, as
if that was all that was necessary. “I’ll leave the
details to you boys. When you have the submarine
ready we will go. Meanwhile, I can be
collecting other specimens. At present I must put
away this rare lady bug that I got from Susan. It
is really quite valuable, and I must make some
notes concerning it before I forget them.”</p>

<p>He went into Jerry’s house, where he was always
a welcome guest, leaving the boys to stare in
surprise at one another.</p>

<p>“Well, if he isn’t the limit!” exclaimed Ned.
“He tells us to let him know when the submarine
is ready, just as though it was only a call to a
meal.”</p>

<p>“Or as if we could produce a submarine at a
minute’s notice, the way the magician in the show
brings a rabbit out of a hat,” added Jerry. “The
professor expects us to do wonders. A submarine,
and we haven’t even so much as a ballast tank!”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe we could buy a second-hand submarine,
if we could not have one made,” suggested
Bob.</p>

<p>“Ha! Chunky is getting up his spunk,” spoke
Ned. “Well, we’ll have to think this over. Meanwhile
I guess I’d better be getting on home. Come
on, Jerry, we’ll put away the <i>Comet</i> and to-morrow,
or next day, we can talk over this latest
stunt. I’m rather for it, myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“So am I,” said the tall lad.</p>

<p>But the boys were not destined to immediately
consider ways and means of obtaining a submarine.
Hardly had Jerry and his chums put away
the airship in the big shed than the storm through
which they had passed, out near Boston, reached
Cresville. The blow began gently enough, and
for a time it seemed that there would be no special
disturbance. But, as the day advanced, the fury of
the gale grew until the wind had attained the force
of a hurricane.</p>

<p>“Say, we seem to be taking a special course in
storms,” remarked Jerry to his mother and the
professor that afternoon, when one or two shutters
had been blown from the Hopkins house.
“This is almost as bad as the one at sea when we
saw the submarine.”</p>

<p>But the professor was oblivious to everything
but writing out facts concerning the rare lady bug,
and with making memoranda concerning the hermit
crabs, of which he soon hoped to start in
search.</p>

<p>Jerry was kept busy tying back window blinds,
and in mending a rain-pipe leader that had become
displaced, letting the water flood the cellar.</p>

<p>Attired in a raincoat and rubber boots, the tall
lad was working away when Ned came splashing
through the storm. He seemed much excited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” panted Jerry, ceasing
from his labors.</p>

<p>“Say, this is a fearful blow!” burst out Ned.
“Two or three houses in town have been unroofed,
and when I came past the newspaper office just
now I saw a bulletin to the effect that out at sea
it was much worse. It is feared that a number of
ships have been sunk.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m glad we’re safe on land,” remarked
Jerry. “Say, lend me a hand for a minute, Ned;
will you? Just hold that piece of pipe until I slip
this section into it. The wind blew it out of the
fastenings.”</p>

<p>“This wind would do almost anything!” cried
Ned, as he helped his chum. “I could hardly walk
up the street. The chimney blew off the roof of
Mr. Black’s house, and some of the bricks just
missed me.”</p>

<p>“‘A miss is as good as a mile’,” quoted Jerry
with a laugh. “But it sure is some blow, all right!
I’m glad we’re not out in it in the <i>Comet</i>.”</p>

<p>“Same here. Whew! That was a fierce one!”
cried Ned as a blast of wind almost tore the rain
pipe from his grasp.</p>

<p>“Look out!” cried Jerry. “Duck!” and he
pushed his chum aside just in time, as a slate from
the roof sailed past them and crashed to pieces on
the stone walk at their side. Ned turned a little
pale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thanks, old man,” he said quietly. “You
saved me from a bad cut.”</p>

<p>“I saw it just in time,” returned Jerry. “So
the bulletin says the storm is even worse out at
sea; eh?”</p>

<p>“It does, and say—Bob’s uncle and cousin!
They must be out in it. He said their boat would
arrive in a day or so!”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” cried Jerry. “I never thought of
that. It may be bad for the Sheldons. I wish we
could help them, but I don’t see how we can. Poor
old Bob will worry, and——”</p>

<p>“Here he comes now!” interrupted Ned, as
he saw a figure splashing along the street. “He
acts as though he had news, too!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>BAD NEWS</small></h2>


<p>“What’s the matter, Bob?” yelled Jerry,
when his stout chum was near enough to hear
above the roar of the wind. “You look worried!”</p>

<p>“I am!” was the answer. “She’s adrift!
Come on down and make her fast or she’ll pound
to pieces on the rocks!”</p>

<p>“Are you talking about that ship your uncle is
supposed to be coming over on?” asked Ned in
surprise.</p>

<p>“No! I never thought of them until just now!”
panted Bob, coming to a pause. “They <em>are</em> out
in this storm, though; aren’t they? I wonder if
they’re safe?”</p>

<p>“Then you didn’t mean them?” asked Jerry,
who had, by this time, managed to slip the leader
pipe into place.</p>

<p>“No, I was speaking about our motor boat!”
cried Bob. “Sud Snuffles just yelled at me, as he
rushed past our house, that she had chafed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
through the mooring ropes and was going down
stream. Isn’t this an awful storm, though?”</p>

<p>“I should say so!” cried Jerry. “But we’ve
got to get busy! Come on, fellows. We don’t
want our boat smashed!”</p>

<p>Calling to his mother to let her know where he
was going, Jerry led the way, Bob and Ned following
through the storm. They had recently
purchased a new racing motor boat, in addition to
the larger one they used for cruising and general
work, and as Bob splashed through the mud and
water beside Jerry he informed his tall chum that
it was this boat, according to the hasty description
of Sud Snuffles (a curious town character),
that had gone adrift in the storm.</p>

<p>“That’s too bad!” cried Jerry. “She’s not
built for much rough work, and it won’t take much
to damage her. I hope she hasn’t gone too far
down stream.”</p>

<p>As the motor boys turned out of Jerry’s yard
into the street, the three chums almost collided
with a small chap, enveloped in a big raincoat, who
was coming from the opposite direction.</p>

<p>“Look out!” cried Jerry, catching hold of the
small lad so as not to knock him over. Then the
newcomer, after a glance into the faces of the
three, cried out, gaspingly, and in veritable spasms
of words:</p>

<p>“Awful—terrible! Worst storm I ever see!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
A thousand chimneys blown down! Two houses
with no roofs! Whoop! Almost blew me—up
a tree! Won’t be any water left in the river!
Hear that wind! Great guns! One man caught
in barn—it blew down on him—all the ships at
sea are sunk! Look out! Hear that rain!
Whoop!”</p>

<p>The small lad had to pause for breath, after
this outburst, which gave Jerry a chance to say:</p>

<p>“Now then, Andy Rush! Hold on a minute.
We’ve got something else to do beside listening to
you—at least just now. Our racing boat’s adrift
and we’ve got to go after her!”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” cried Andy, who was surely the
most easily excited chap in Cresville, or for miles
around. “Is that so? Too bad—I’ll go along—I
can tie knots well—boat adrift—hundred people
drowned—may upset—catch on fire—bang into
the dock—knock the dock down—go up on land—blow
out a spark plug—what a storm—awful
ain’t it! Whoop!”</p>

<p>“Hold him, somebody, and stuff a handkerchief
in his mouth,” advised Ned. “Come on, fellows,
every second counts!”</p>

<p>“I’ll be good—won’t talk any more—please let
me help you!” begged Andy in slower tones. Indeed
he had to talk more slowly for his breath
was about expended.</p>

<p>“All right, come along,” said Jerry good-naturedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
He and his chums liked Andy Rush,
but he sometimes got on their nerves with his
rapid, disjointed talking. Occasionally they took
him on trips with them.</p>

<p>The four boys hurried on toward the river
through the storm, which seemed to be getting
worse instead of diminishing. The rain came
down in torrents, and, in spite of their waterproof
coats the boys were soon drenched.</p>

<p>“Let’s take to the middle of the street,” suggested
Ned, when a broken shutter, crashing
down, narrowly missed Bob.</p>

<p>“Guess that will be a good idea,” commented
Jerry. “It will be a little safer there.”</p>

<p>“Unless a tree falls on us!” put in Andy.
“That would be fierce! Smash down—crack your
head—pin you fast—make you——”</p>

<p>“Andy!” cried Jerry warningly, “that will do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I forgot. I’ll remember. I——”</p>

<p>Ned gently, but firmly, placed his hand over the
small lad’s mouth as they hurried on.</p>

<p>On every side were evidences of the raging
storm. The streets were littered with debris, some
thoroughfares being almost blocked. Many chimneys
had been blown down, and one or two small
frame houses had collapsed. The persons in them
had barely escaped with their lives, and several
had been injured.</p>

<p>There were pitiful scenes, and the boys made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
up their minds that they would come back and lend
what aid they could to the unfortunates as soon as
they had caught and made fast their fine boat.</p>

<p>“This certainly is fierce!” gasped Jerry, as
they turned down a street leading to the river and
felt the full force of the wind, which, for a space,
had been broken by a row of houses. “I’m afraid
we’ll never get that boat in time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes we will,” asserted Ned, confidently.
“Don’t you dare say we won’t, Jerry Hopkins!”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t want her to smash any more than
you do, but just feel that wind, and think what it
is out on the river! Even a low motor boat, without
any sails, would scud along before it at easily
twenty miles an hour. It’s awful!”</p>

<p>“That about describes it,” agreed Bob. “Say,
but I’m wet. We’ll all need hot coffee after this.”</p>

<p>The rain and wind were chilling, and this time
Bob’s reference to something to eat—or, rather
something to drink—passed unnoticed.</p>

<p>A little later the boys were at the river, and
soon had taken out their large motor boat, which,
fortunately, was all ready to run, and with plenty
of gasoline in the tank.</p>

<p>“Now for a chase!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, and a hard one, too,” added Ned. “I
wonder which way the <i>Scud</i> went?”</p>

<p>“She could only go one way—that is, with the
wind,” declared the tall lad, who had taken his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
place at the wheel. “No boat, even under power,
could make much headway against this gale. Turn
her over, boys, and we’ll see what happens.”</p>

<p>With the four lads aboard the staunch motor
boat started out on the search, going with the
wind. So fierce was the gale, and so swiftly did it
send the boat along, that there was hardly need for
the propeller, but Jerry kept it going at top speed,
for he wanted to make the best time he could, and
save the <i>Scud</i>, which was the name of the racing
boat, before she pounded herself to pieces on the
rocks.</p>

<p>The river was deserted by other craft, and the
boys realized the risk they were taking in being
out on the water in such a storm. But they were
used to taking chances, and they simply had to try
to save their fine craft.</p>

<p>In a short time they had covered several miles,
and they had looked, unavailingly, all along the
way for a sight of the <i>Scud</i>.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid she’s sunk,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Too bad,” murmured Andy Rush.</p>

<p>“Look! What’s that?” suddenly cried Ned,
pointing through the mist of rain to something
afloat ahead of them. “That’s some sort of a
boat!”</p>

<p><a href="#image02">“She’s the <i>Scud</i>!” shouted Bob.</a> “And she’s
all right, so far. Hurry up, Jerry!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;">
<a name="image02" id="image02">
  <img src="images/image02.jpg" width="380" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_51">“SHE’S THE SCUD!” SHOUTED BOB.</a></div>
</div>

<p>The tall steersman threw the throttle full over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and the motor craft shot ahead, aided by the wind.
A little later they were alongside the <i>Scud</i>, and
had made her fast to the other boat. The racing
craft was somewhat scratched from having come
in contact with floating debris, or the rocks in the
river, but the damage was comparatively slight.</p>

<p>“It’s good to get her back again!” cried Bob.
“Good old <i>Scud</i>!”</p>

<p>“And we didn’t get her any too soon!” exclaimed
Jerry. “A little more and she’d have
been on those rocks, and she’d have been a wreck
when we got her off,” and he pointed to a menacing
ledge of stone just ahead. Indeed it required
skillful navigating for the boys themselves to get
past the danger point, with the strong wind urging
them on.</p>

<p>“We’d better not try to work back against this
gale,” said Bob. “Can’t we tie the boats up somewhere
along here, and go back in a car or train?
We can get them later.”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” said Jerry. “We’ll do it.”</p>

<p>They obtained permission from a friendly boatman
to leave their two launches tied at his dock,
and making sure they were well fastened, the boys
set off on their way to Cresville.</p>

<p>They were fortunate in catching a train, for they
had come several miles from home, but in due
time they were again trudging the streets of their
town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The storm was still at its height, and considerable
more damage had been done to the various
buildings. A relief corps had been organized, and
the boys were about to offer their services when
Bob, who had gone over to look at the bulletin in
front of the newspaper office, came back with a
serious look on his face.</p>

<p>“What is it?” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Bad news, fellows. There’s a wireless
message there, from Boston. It says that several
large steamers are in distress, and that a number
of small boats have foundered. But that isn’t the
worst. The <i>Hassen</i>, with my uncle and cousin on
board, has sunk, so the dispatch says,” and the
tears came into poor Bob’s eyes.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>OFF ON A SEARCH</small></h2>


<p>For a moment Jerry and Ned stared almost
uncomprehendingly at the boy who brought such
startling news. Then Jerry exclaimed:</p>

<p>“It can’t be possible, Bob! There must be some
mistake!”</p>

<p>“I only wish there was,” went on the stout lad.
“Not that I want any other vessel to be wrecked,
either. But the dispatch says plainly that the <i>Hassen</i>
has gone down. It’s a peculiar name, and
there’s hardly any likelihood of an error. No,
I’m afraid it’s all up with Uncle Nelson and
Cousin Grace!”</p>

<p>“Too bad!” sympathized Ned. “Now you
won’t know what it was he was bringing over with
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I fancy my folks know,” said Bob. “But
I don’t care so much about that.”</p>

<p>“I should say not,” agreed Jerry. “Think of
being out in the ocean in such weather as this!
Poor girl!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“They might have escaped—have taken to the
small boats or the life rafts,” suggested Ned. “I
wouldn’t give up all hope, Bob, old man.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course there’s a small chance,” admitted
the stout youth in a despondent tone; “but
not much in such a storm as this. A small boat
couldn’t live an hour in such a sea as there must
be off this coast. It’s awful!”</p>

<p>“Well, hope for the best,” came from Jerry.
“Things are bad enough here. Look at the
ruin!” and he gazed about him. The others saw
the destruction on every side, caused by the high
wind. Scarcely a street but what was littered
with debris, and many houses were uninhabitable
by reason of being unroofed or through the breaking
of water and drain pipes.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get busy and help!” exclaimed
Ned. “See! there’s another volunteer corps being
organized. Let’s join it. We can’t get any wetter;
and it will help to take Bob’s mind off his
trouble,” Ned added in lower tones to Jerry.</p>

<p>“You’re right, old man. Work is the best thing
for that. Come on, Bob, let’s get busy. You, too,
Andy Rush!”</p>

<p>“That’s what I want to do—help!” cried the
excitable lad. “Save lives—put out fire—pump
a cellar dry—build up a chimney—here we go—come
on, everybody—let her go—whoop!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“If he keeps on that way he won’t get much
done,” commented Bob with a smile.</p>

<p>“Let him go,” advised Jerry. “Talk is his
safety valve. I’d hate to think what would happen
to him if he couldn’t work off his energy that
way.”</p>

<p>Just then Ned saw his father talking to the
mayor of the town, and hurried over to them.</p>

<p>“Ah, Ned!” exclaimed Mr. Slade, “we were
just beginning to worry about you. This is awful—terrible.
I have thrown open my department
store to the use of the relief corps. We will house
and feed as many there as we can. Other merchants
are doing the same. You boys may bring
any unfortunates you meet. The salespeople, and
everyone there, has orders to spare nothing.”</p>

<p>“That’s bully, Dad!” exclaimed Ned. “We
were just going to start in and help. We had to
go off after our boat that got adrift.”</p>

<p>“So I understand. Well, I’ll tell your mother
you’re all right.”</p>

<p>“And if it wouldn’t be too much trouble, could
you let my mother know I’m safe?” asked Jerry.
“Then I won’t have to go home.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll do that, and for you and Andy, too,
Bob. Now boys, show what sort of stuff you’re
made of. This is quite a calamity for Cresville,
but other places have suffered worse, and it’s up to
us to meet it bravely. Now, Mr. Mayor, don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
fail to call on me for any aid in my power to give.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Slade, I’ll remember. You’re
a citizen to be proud of. Mr. Baker has offered
me all the funds I need.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” murmured Bob, glad that his
father, too, had taken a hand in helping the unfortunates.</p>

<p>“Oh, I almost forgot,” said Mr. Slade.
“Mrs. Hopkins telephoned me a little while ago,
Mr. Mayor, to the effect that she and some ladies
were organizing a nursing corps, so that any injured
persons will receive all the medical attention
they need.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried the town executive. “It’s a
comfort to have such citizens in Cresville. Now,
if you’ll excuse me, I’ll go see how our relief work
is coming on.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I guess it’s up to us to get on the job,
too!” added Jerry. “Come on, fellows.”</p>

<p>While Mr. Slade hurried off to send word of the
safety of the lads, Jerry and his chums placed
themselves at the service of one of the several
chairmen of the relief corps that had hastily been
organized. The boys found much to do, and it
was not easy work, as the storm continued to rage.</p>

<p>“I think it’s slacking up a bit, though,” remarked
Bob when there came a chance for him
and his chums to take a breathing spell. They had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
worked hard and faithfully, even the excitable
Andy Rush proving a real hero.</p>

<p>“Yes, the wind isn’t quite so strong,” agreed
Jerry. “I’ll be glad, though, when we can get on
something dry.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind the wet so much if we could
get a hot cup of coffee,” spoke Bob, and his chums
were so much of his opinion that they made no reference
to his allusion to food.</p>

<p>“Speak of coffee and——” began Ned, not finishing
the sentence, for with a wave of his hand he
indicated a group of women, attired in men’s rubber
coats, who were going about with a small cart,
in which stood a steaming wash boiler full of it.</p>

<p>“Say, there’s my mother!” cried Jerry, and,
sure enough, the wealthy widow, with some of her
friends, was going about giving hot coffee to the
drenched and weary workers. “That’s the stuff,
Mother!” cried Jerry, heartily. “Got any left?”</p>

<p>“Indeed we have, boys!” answered Mrs. Rutledge,
a neighbor of the Hopkinses.</p>

<p>A number of the volunteers surrounded the little
cart, and soon the coffee was being enjoyed. Jerry
hastily told his mother of saving the boat, and
then, as there was still much to be done, the boys
resumed their rescue labors.</p>

<p>Fortunately no fires had broken out to add to
the horror, or the history of Cresville might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
been different. As it was, damage was done that
took years to repair.</p>

<p>But the storm was really too fierce to last a
great while, and the wind gradually died down,
though the rain continued to fall for some time.</p>

<p>But now most of the homeless had been given
temporary shelter, and the injured sent to hospitals,
or were taken care of in private houses.
There was no more for the boys to do, and, at
Jerry’s suggestion, they adjourned to his house,
which was the nearest. There they put on some
of his spare clothes, though Bob looked so funny
in them that Ned and Jerry laughed.</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” said Bob. “I’m too worried to
mind what you fellows say—or do.”</p>

<p>“You mean about your cousin and uncle?”
asked Ned, sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Sure. The news will break mother and dad
all up, I’m afraid. My uncle was mother’s brother,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe there’ll be better news in the
morning,” said Jerry. “Even if the <i>Hassen</i> sank,
some other steamship may have picked up the passengers.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll have to wait and see,” said Bob.
“What’s that?” he exclaimed, as the sound of a
fall came from the next room.</p>

<p>Jerry rushed out, to return a moment later
smiling, and remarked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“You might have known. It was Professor
Snodgrass. He was after some sort of a bug on
the library wall, and stumbled over a chair.
Mother says he started out with her on the rescue
work, but every once in a while he’d see something
he wanted as a specimen, and he’d stop to get it.
Finally she went on without him.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad this day is over,” said Ned.
“It’s been a hard one!”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Bob. “Say,” he went
on, “have you fellows thought any more about
that submarine trip the professor wants to take?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t,” confessed Jerry. “There hasn’t
been time.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how we’re going to do it,” spoke
Ned. “A submarine boat is quite a big proposition.
It isn’t like building an aeroplane.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can think about it later,” suggested
Jerry. “Just now I want to lie down and rest,”
and he stretched out on a couch near the hearth,
where a fire had been built.</p>

<p>Gradually something like order came out of the
chaos in Cresville. Many willing hands worked
hard to repair the damage, and the next day most
of the streets were cleared. Then came the slower
process of repairing the damaged buildings and
the recovery of the injured. But with that this
story has nothing to do.</p>

<p>Eagerly the boys looked for further reports of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the steamship <i>Hassen</i>. The bad news was only
too soon confirmed. The next day’s papers contained
an account of the wreck of several vessels.</p>

<p>Among the dispatches was a story of the foundering
of the ship on which Mr. Sheldon and his
daughter Grace had sailed from Germany.</p>

<p>“Well, that ends it,” said Bob, mournfully,
when, with his two chums, he had read the account.
“Poor Uncle Nelson! That’s the last of him.
And he was such a jolly man, too. Poor Grace!”</p>

<p>Jerry seemed to be in a brown study. He
seemed to neither hear nor see his friends.</p>

<p>“No!” he suddenly exclaimed.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Ned curiously.</p>

<p>“It isn’t the end, fellows!” vigorously went on
Jerry, springing to his feet, and beginning to pace
the room. “There may be a chance yet!”</p>

<p>“For whom?” demanded Bob.</p>

<p>“Your uncle!” was the answer. “Even if the
vessel did sink he and his daughter may have taken
to a boat. And some of those lifeboats can live
through a bad storm. Boys, I’ve got a plan. Let’s
take the <i>Comet</i> and sail around the place where
the <i>Hassen</i> is supposed to have gone down. It’s a
bare chance, but it’s worth taking. Are you with
me?”</p>

<p>“Of course!” cried Ned. “We’ll start at once.
Maybe we can pick them up—and some other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
castaways, too. Of course we’re with you, Jerry,
old man!”</p>

<p>Bob said nothing, but there was more than
words in the manner in which he clasped Jerry’s
hand.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>NODDY AND BILL</small></h2>


<p>“There, I guess that will do!”</p>

<p>“Should it not be put up a little farther forward?”</p>

<p>“No, it will light up better where it is. Besides,
we can’t move it any farther forward, or it
will interfere with the hydroplane lever.”</p>

<p>“That’s right.”</p>

<p>The above colloquy took place between Jerry,
Ned and Bob in the big shed that housed the
motorship <i>Comet</i>, a few hours after their decision
to start in their air craft in search of the
wreck of the <i>Hassen</i>. The boys had lost no time
going over their wonderful craft to put her in the
best possible condition for a long, and possibly
dangerous, flight.</p>

<p>They had determined to start at once on the
search, for well they knew the terrible distress the
shipwrecked persons might be in—with nothing
but an open boat between them and the vast ocean.</p>

<p>But there were a few needful things to be done,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and one was the installation of a large searchlight,
and it was concerning this that the talk had been.</p>

<p>Bob was of the opinion that the big lamp should
go farther toward the bow, but Jerry had his own
reasons for placing it where it was. The light was
a new one, much larger than the one heretofore in
use, and it had been purchased and installed in a
hurry.</p>

<p>“For we may have to stay on the wing all
night,” said Ned, “and this light may enable us to
locate even a small boat on the ocean.”</p>

<p>“But if we do find my uncle and cousin in a
small boat, how can we save them?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Easily enough, if the sea isn’t too rough,” replied
Jerry. “We can drop the hydroplanes, and
descend to them. If it’s too rough we can drop a
rope, and haul them up, or even tow the boat if we
have to. I’m not worrying about that part of it.
The thing to do first is to find them.”</p>

<p>“And that isn’t going to be so easy,” observed
Bob, with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be crossing bridges until you can
hear the rustling of their wings,” spoke Ned, with
a smile at his chum. “Now let’s get busy, stock
up, and set out on this cruise. We’ve lost a lot of
time as it is.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Jerry. “But we’re doing
the best we can.”</p>

<p>“I know that,” spoke Bob, with a grateful look.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
“Our folks say it’s mighty kind of you boys to
take this trouble.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Why wouldn’t we?” demanded Ned.
“I guess we’re as much interested in this rescue as
you are, Bob Baker.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s good of you. I’m glad it was the
storm that sunk the <i>Hassen</i>, and not that German
submarine. If that boat had rammed the steamer
she might have gone down so quickly that no one
would have had a chance for life.”</p>

<p>“Oh, try to forget that submarine,” protested
Jerry. “You’re getting it on the brain.”</p>

<p>“Like Professor Snodgrass,” spoke Ned.
“Only a little while ago, when I went in the house,
Jerry, to get some of that high tension wire, he
asked me if we had started on it yet.”</p>

<p>“What’d you tell him?”</p>

<p>“That we had other fish to fry. I spoke of our
trip in the <i>Comet</i> and of course he wanted to come
along. He said if he couldn’t get his hermit crab
specimens right away he might find some new bugs
up in the air. So I told him he was welcome to
come.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Jerry. “We may need
his help if it comes to a rescue.”</p>

<p>“The only trouble is,” remarked Bob, with a
smile, “that if we sight that submarine again the
professor may insist on being put aboard so he can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
get to the bottom of the sea. What will we do
then?”</p>

<p>“Wait until it happens—worry then,” advised
Jerry, with a laugh. “I don’t imagine that submarine
is within a thousand miles of us.”</p>

<p>“Me either,” added Ned.</p>

<p>But neither he nor Jerry realized how soon
their idle words were to be proven wrong.</p>

<p>All haste was made in preparing the <i>Comet</i> for
her rescue trip. The parents of the boys thoroughly
approved of it, for the motor lads had
undertaken so many strenuous “stunts” in their
craft that even Mrs. Hopkins no longer worried
much when Jerry and his chums went out in her.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we’re ready to start,” announced
Jerry, a little later, after a look at the airship.
Everything had been put in first class shape, and
the rudder, that had given so much trouble before,
had been replaced by a different one.</p>

<p>“Look who’s there,” said Bob in a low voice,
nodding toward the roadway in front of the Hopkins
house.</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon,” muttered Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, and Bill Berry is with him,” went on Bob.
“They seem to be looking in here pretty sharply.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they probably see that we’re getting
ready for a trip,” spoke Ned. “I hope they won’t
try to follow us, and make trouble.”</p>

<p>Jerry looked annoyed. Noddy and Bill were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
staring insolently in the direction of the open shed
which housed the airship. Even a passer-by could
see that it was in readiness for a flight.</p>

<p>Jerry, who, with his chums, had not seen much
of Noddy since the bully and his crony had vainly
tried to get the sixty nuggets of gold, as told in the
last volume, started toward the front gate. Noddy
saw him coming, but did not move.</p>

<p>“Were you looking for me?” asked Jerry, in
no friendly voice.</p>

<p>“I don’t know as I was,” returned Noddy, in
surly tones.</p>

<p>“If you are,” put in Ned, who had stepped to
the side of his chum, “you won’t find any gold
nuggets to try and get away from us this time.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Think you’re mighty smart; don’t
you?” sneered Bill Berry.</p>

<p>“We were smart enough to fool you and the
Dominion police you set on us,” laughed Bob.
“Now will you have gravy on your pancakes?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you talk that way to us!” growled Bill.
“If you do——”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on, we don’t want anything to do
with them,” said Noddy quickly, taking his crony
by the arm and leading him to one side.</p>

<p>“Glad you’ve come to that conclusion,” spoke
Jerry, as he turned back toward the airship shed.
“Come on, fellows,” he added to his chums, “we’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
better get started. Bob, ask Professor Snodgrass
if he’s ready.”</p>

<p>Noddy and Bill started down the street. They
were talking earnestly together.</p>

<p>“They’re going off on another trip, that’s sure,”
Noddy said.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” growled Bill. “But I don’t see
that it makes any difference to us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you?” asked Noddy. “Well, it
might. I’ve a notion to get out my airship and
follow them.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“What for? Because I need the money; that’s
what for.”</p>

<p>“Money? How do you know they’re going
after money?”</p>

<p>“Because they ’most always are. Now, Bill, it’s
like this. Everything we’ve done, lately, has been
a fizzle. We’ve lost out every time.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was as much your fault as mine,”
growled Bill.</p>

<p>“Maybe it was,” assented Noddy, who seemed
to have some special reason for not wanting to
quarrel with his crony. “But when Jerry and
his two chums start off it’s ’most always because
they can make something out of it. Now I need
money.”</p>

<p>“So do I, for that matter.”</p>

<p>“Our last trip didn’t pan out,” went on Noddy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
“and my father has shut down on me. I’ve got to
get some cash, and the only way I know to get it
is to follow these chaps. They may be going out
to locate another gold mine.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m with you then,” agreed Bill. “Is
your airship ready to run?”</p>

<p>“I can make her so in a little while. Let’s go
back to our house.”</p>

<p>For a time, after getting into trouble, Noddy
had left town with his parents, who thought of remaining
away permanently, but Mr. Nixon had
since moved back to Cresville, though living in a
different house than the one he formerly occupied.
Noddy, as my former readers know, had a large
airship. It was one of several he had owned, and,
though it was nowhere near as complete and powerful
as the <i>Comet</i>, was quite serviceable.</p>

<p>So, while Noddy and Bill were preparing to follow
our friends, in the hope of trailing them to
some hidden fortune, Jerry and his chums were
getting ready for the rescue flight.</p>

<p>“I’ll be with you in a few minutes!” called
Professor Snodgrass when he was told that the
start would soon be made. “I just want to get a
small net, with a long handle, because I may see
some rare insects in the upper air. We’ll have to
let the sea crabs go for a time, until you boys can
build a submarine.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that will be a long while,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Jerry, as he looked to see that the plane-shifting
levers worked properly.</p>

<p>It was decided to navigate at first as an aeroplane,
since, after the storm, the weather was very
calm. By telegraph, as good a description as possible
had been obtained as to where the <i>Hassen</i>
had been last seen. The boys intended to cruise
around over this spot in ever-increasing circles.</p>

<p>“All aboard!” cried Bob, as he climbed up on
the main deck. “We’ve got enough to eat for two
weeks.”</p>

<p>“Trust Chunky for that,” commented Ned with
a smile. “Are you coming, Professor.”</p>

<p>“Yes!” cried the little scientist. “I think I
have everything. I am going——” he had started
from the house toward the airship, but stopped
suddenly to peer at something on the ground.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a find!” he cried. “Oh, what a
lucky find!”</p>

<p>In an instant he was on his knees and was carefully
lifting into one of his boxes some little creature.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Jerry, with a smile.</p>

<p>“A very rare specimen of a green striped angle-worm,”
was the answer. “I have been looking
for one for years. Now, if I could only get another,”
and the professor began searching on the
ground.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid, Professor Snodgrass, that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
can’t wait,” said Jerry. “We ought to be under
way now.”</p>

<p>“All right,” was the answer. “Though it is a
pity to lose this chance. I say, Dick,” called the
scientist to the gardener, “if you see a green
striped angle-worm——”</p>

<p>“I’ll be sure to kill it, Professor,” interrupted
the man. “I know the creatures, eating up the
cabbages, and everything else. I’ll kill every one
I see.”</p>

<p>“No, no! For the love of science don’t do
that!” was the appeal of the professor. “I beg
of you not to do that. I will give you two dollars
for every one you save for me, Dick!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that, Professor?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll search for ’em with a dark lantern
to-night,” was the answer. “I’ll have a lot for
you when you come back.”</p>

<p>“Ah, what a lucky day!” cried the professor, as
he got aboard the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>Good-byes were called to Mrs. Hopkins, and to
the mothers of Bob and Ned, who had called at
Jerry’s house to see the start. The boys took their
places, the professor was in the cabin, writing out
a description of his latest find, and all was in
readiness.</p>

<p>“Here we go!” cried Jerry, as he swung over
the lever that started the propeller motor. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
<i>Comet</i> rolled across the smooth starting ground.
Then, as the elevating rudder was tilted the craft
shot into the air like a bird, soon attaining a good
height.</p>

<p>At the same time, off to one side of the town,
another aeroplane darted forward, trailing the one
carrying our friends.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>THE WRECK</small></h2>


<p>“We’ve got good weather, anyhow,” remarked
Ned, as he and his chums stood in the pilot house
of the <i>Comet</i>, which Jerry was guiding on her
aerial way. “It couldn’t be better.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Bob. “I’m glad, too,
for the sake of Uncle Nelson and Cousin Grace—that
is, if they are still alive. Bad weather in an
open boat at sea is terrible!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think they’re alive,” spoke Jerry, cheerfully.
“Just think how many cases there have been
of shipwrecked persons living for weeks in open
boats, with hardly any food and water.”</p>

<p>“But it’s awful, just the same,” sighed Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll pick ’em up,” declared Jerry, with
more cheerfulness than he really felt.</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> sailed steadily onward, high above
the earth. It would be an hour or more, on the
route Jerry had selected, before they would be
over the ocean. Then the real search would begin.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the occupants of the motorship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
busied themselves about various tasks. Bob, as
might be expected, was in the galley, getting ready
the next meal. Ned went about the machinery, oiling
it, and seeing that all the apparatus was working
properly. Jerry remained in the pilot house.
All of the boys took turns steering, but Jerry
seemed more fitted for this exacting task than
either Ned or Bob.</p>

<p>As for Professor Snodgrass he was still engaged
in making notes about the new worm he had found.
He paid little attention to the working of the airship,
though, in case of necessity, he always lent
his aid.</p>

<p>The boys had gone on for perhaps ten miles
when Ned, looking back, and seeing a speck in the
sky, called out:</p>

<p>“I say! What’s that? A bird?”</p>

<p>Bob, who had come out on the rear deck where
Ned was, looked long and earnestly.</p>

<p>“That isn’t a bird,” he said. “It’s another airship,
or I’m mistaken.”</p>

<p>“Let’s tell Jerry,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“And get the glass to make a better observation,”
added his chum. “It seems to be following
us.”</p>

<p>Jerry set the automatic steering gear, which, for
a certain time, would guide the airship without the
attention of human hands. Then the tall lad took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
a long and careful observation through the telescope.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked Ned, somewhat impatiently.</p>

<p>“It’s an airship, all right,” announced Jerry,
“and, unless I’m making a big mistake, it’s Noddy
Nixon’s.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried Ned and Bob together.</p>

<p>“That’s what I believe,” went on Jerry. “Take
a look, you fellows.”</p>

<p>In turn Ned and Bob viewed the speck in the air
behind them. Both agreed that it was an airship,
but they were not of one opinion as to the ownership.
Ned was sure it was not Noddy’s, while Bob
agreed with Jerry.</p>

<p>“If it is Noddy, what are you going to do?”
asked Ned. “Mind you, I’m not dead positive it
isn’t. Just suppose it is—what’ll you do?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” answered Jerry, as he turned to go
back to the pilot house. “Just keep on—that’s all.
When he finds that we’re going to stay out over
the ocean for several days, maybe he won’t be so
anxious to follow us. So we’ll just keep on; that’s
all.”</p>

<p>The professor only looked up dreamily when
told that they were being followed by an airship.
All he said was:</p>

<p>“I hope it doesn’t scare away all the rare insects.”</p>

<p>Then he went outside to sit on the after deck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and look for unusual specimens that he might capture.
Bob and Ned took turns watching the other
craft through the glass, while Jerry steered. It
did not take long for Ned to agreed with his two
chums that it was indeed Noddy Nixon’s craft that
was following them.</p>

<p>“You fellows are right,” he said. “Are you
still going to do nothing, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Well, we might try a little trick on him.”</p>

<p>“A trick—how?”</p>

<p>“Blanket him, as one sail boat does another in
a race,” said Jerry. “We can sail all around him,
you know, even if he has a powerful craft. So,
when we get near the coast, we’ll just turn back,
circle over him, and get low enough down to cut
off some of his air. That will stall him, and he’ll
be glad enough to volplane down to earth. He
can do it, for we’ve seen him lots of times. Then
we’ll go on, and I guess Noddy will have enough
so he won’t want to follow—especially when he
sees us heading out to sea.”</p>

<p>Jerry slowed up the <i>Comet</i> so that Noddy’s
craft gained. By means of the glass the figures of
Noddy and Bill could be made out plainly now.
When Noddy found that he was approaching too
close he tried to slacken speed. But he was too
late.</p>

<p>Turning on full power Jerry turned, and made
a dash for his enemy. At first Noddy feared a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
collision, and even cried out a protest. But the
tall motor lad knew what he was doing. A moment
later, and just as the seacoast came in sight,
he soared closer to Noddy’s craft, and hovered
over it. This, together with the suction caused by
the powerful propellers of the <i>Comet</i>, created an
“air pocket.” Jerry had counted on this.</p>

<p>In an instant Noddy’s craft dived downward,
but, as the tall lad well knew, Noddy realized his
danger and took the usual precautions. He shut
off his engine, and volplaned, or glided, down to
earth. As Jerry watched him nearing the white
sands of the beach he swerved the <i>Comet</i> and,
with the throttles wide open, sent her out to sea.</p>

<p>“There, I guess he’s had enough of trying to
follow us this time,” said Jerry, grimly.</p>

<p>And, down on the beach, where they made a
safe, but rather sudden landing, Noddy and Bill
accused each other of being to blame for the accident.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the <i>Comet</i> kept on, the motor boys
chuckling to themselves at the way they had made
Noddy take to earth. He could not start upward
again in time to follow them, for the <i>Comet</i> was
soon out of sight of land.</p>

<p>And now the real search began. Dinner was
served by Bob, and a bountiful meal it was. Down
below glittered the calm sea—calm after all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
turmoil that had sent several gallant ships to the
bottom.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass busied himself with his
scientific work, now and then making a capture of
some upper-air insect, or making notes of those
already in his possession.</p>

<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry kept watchful eyes on the
waters below them. They saw many sailing and
steam vessels, and were themselves the cynosure of
many eyes which gazed aloft at the fine air craft.</p>

<p>Jerry had worked out, as he best could, the approximate
position of the <i>Hassen</i> as it was reported
when she was last seen. Getting to a place
near this, the airship was sent about in ever-increasing
circles, covering a wide area over the surface
of the sea.</p>

<p>The motorship worked to perfection. Not a
trace of the former trouble was noticeable. Jerry
and his chums had done their work well.</p>

<p>The night of the first day of the search began to
settle down. The big search lamp was set aglow,
and by the aid of its powerful rays the boys looked
for a sight of a wreck, or some small boat that
might have come from the <i>Hassen</i>.</p>

<p>If they expected to have success at once they
were mistaken. But Jerry pointed out that this
could hardly be.</p>

<p>“It’s a chance—and a bare chance—that we’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
taking,” he said. “The only thing to do is to keep
on.”</p>

<p>And keep on they did. All that night they circled
about, taking watch-and-watch. The morning
dawned, finding them far at sea, and without having
sighted that which they sought.</p>

<p>It was toward the close of the second day when
the professor, who was out on the rear deck, trying
to capture a strange bug that had been following
the airship, suddenly called:</p>

<p>“Look here, boys! What’s this? The submarine,
or a wreck?”</p>

<p>The three rushed to his side, Jerry setting the
automatic steerer as he left the pilot house. The
professor pointed down toward the water.</p>

<p>There, rising and falling sluggishly on the surface,
was some craft. And, at the sight of it Jerry
cried:</p>

<p>“That’s no submarine! It’s a wreck, sure
enough. A steamship, too. Maybe she’s the
<i>Hassen</i>! We’ll soon find out!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>THE LONE SAILOR</small></h2>


<p>Down shot the <i>Comet</i>, as Jerry shifted the
depression rudder. Down, down, closer and
closer to the surface of the ocean, where rolling
sluggishly, showing her water-logged condition,
was the wrecked steamship. Anxiously the boys
looked to see if she should prove to be the craft
for which they were looking. She seemed silent
and deserted—as though all had fled from her,
or had, perhaps, been washed away by the angry
sea.</p>

<p>“Stand by to lower the hydroplanes!” called
Jerry to Ned and Bob. “We’ll try a landing on
them.”</p>

<p>“Is it calm enough?” asked Professor Snodgrass,
who had, on hearing of the sighting of the
wreck, left his scientific work to give the boys any
aid that might be needed.</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s only a gentle swell,” answered the
tall steersman. “It will be safe to use the hydroplanes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>On these the motorship could float, motionless
if need be, while the boys investigated the wreck.</p>

<p>“All ready there, Ned?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“All ready, old man.”</p>

<p>“Here, Bob, you give me a hand with this
wheel. I may have to make a sudden turn in case
the wreck drifts too close to us.”</p>

<p>“All right, Jerry,” and the stout lad, who had
been in the galley up to the time of sighting the
steamer, hurried to the pilot house.</p>

<p>“Professor, you might give Ned a little help,”
went on the steersman. “Those planes haven’t
been used lately, and they may be a trifle stiff.”</p>

<p>“Of course, Jerry,” and the scientist, laying
aside his precious notes, went out on the main
deck.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer to the wreck went the <i>Comet</i>.
Every moment the boys dared spare from the
wheels and levers they peered at the steamship,
rolling lazily on the swell below them.</p>

<p>Would she prove to be the <i>Hassen</i>?</p>

<p>“Can you make out any name?” asked Ned,
standing ready with his hand on the hydroplane
lever.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” answered the professor.</p>

<p>It was Bob who made the welcome discovery,
and perhaps, since it was Bob’s relatives they had
come to save, it was very fitting that the stout lad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
should have had this honor. Bob gave a cry,
which caused Jerry to turn and look at him.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the tall lad.</p>

<p>“That steamer! She’s the <i>Hassen</i>, all right! I
just caught a glimpse of the name under her stern
as she rolled that time.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Positive! There! You can see for yourself!”</p>

<p>Jerry looked, as the vessel rolled again, and
he, too, saw the name in gold letters on the black
paint of the stern. The wreck was indeed that of
the <i>Hassen</i>.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve found her,” said Jerry in a low
voice. “Now to see if anyone’s aboard. It
doesn’t look so. Here we go, Ned! Down with
that lever!”</p>

<p>“Down she is!”</p>

<p>A moment later Jerry shut off the power from
the big propellers, and the <i>Comet</i> swept gently to
the surface of the sea, where she floated close to
the wrecked steamer.</p>

<p>“Well, she didn’t sink after all,” said Bob. “I
wonder what became of the passengers and crew?
For there doesn’t appear to be a soul aboard.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Ned, “and she doesn’t
seem to be sinking, even. There’s a sort of mystery
about her.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not so much,” put in Jerry, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
watched to note the drift of the wreck and the
airship. He did not want a collision which might
damage the frailer craft. “Possibly in the storm
some water came in, or the engines may have
stopped. That would cause a panic, and the
boats may have been lowered, and have taken
everyone off, although, all the while, the steamer
was in good condition. I’ve read of such cases.”</p>

<p>“That is very true,” said Professor Snodgrass.
“In time of storm and peril one loses control of
one’s self, and does things one would not otherwise
do. Probably the poor souls who deserted
this ship would have done better to stay aboard.”</p>

<p>“Too bad!” exclaimed Bob, mournfully. “If
my uncle and cousin had stayed here they might
be alive now.”</p>

<p>“And they may be still!” cried Jerry, quickly.
“We’re not going to give up yet. Why, I think
it’s good luck that we located the wreck. We did
it sooner than I expected. And when we go
aboard we may find some message they left—we
may even find that mysterious object, or whatever
it was, that your uncle was bringing to this country,
Bob.”</p>

<p>“Are you going aboard?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Certainly. Why not? The sea is calm, and
it will be safe to make our craft fast to the ship.
We’ll take a look around and then start off again
and search for the small boats. It’s them we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
want, for if any persons were saved from the <i>Hassen</i>
they’ll be drifting about in small boats.”</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> was some distance from the <i>Hassen</i>
now, but Jerry slowly started the propellers, which
would take the air craft up to the ship over the
surface of the water on the hydroplanes as well as
though they were sailing through the air, though
not so swiftly.</p>

<p>“Stand by with a line to make her fast, if you
can see anything to tie to, Ned,” called Jerry, as
they approached closer to the wreck.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better go around on the other side?
We may find an accommodation ladder down, or
part of one, and that will make it easier to board
her,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s right, Chunky!” exclaimed Jerry.
“Hold on there a minute, Ned. I’ll put her
around.”</p>

<p>On the other side of the <i>Hassen</i> the boys saw
part of a ladder dangling over the side.</p>

<p>“That’s good!” exclaimed Bob, with a sigh of
content. He was getting stouter than ever and he
did not relish the idea of any unnecessary gymnastics
in boarding the wreck.</p>

<p>“Make fast to that, if you can’t see anything
else, Ned,” suggested Jerry. Ned, however, found
a projection on the side of the wrecked craft, and
took a couple of turns of the rope about it. The
<i>Comet</i> was now drifting with the <i>Hassen</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Up the broken ladder scrambled the boys, followed
by the professor. The decks were a scene
of confusion, showing the power of the gale, and
also the terror that must have inspired passengers
and crew as they were leaving what they believed
to be an ill-fated ship. One or two life boats were
found with their sides or bows stove in, showing
that the waves must, at times, have swept over the
vessel.</p>

<p>“She’s entirely deserted,” said Jerry, in a
low voice. “Not a soul left aboard. And yet, if
they had only known she would keep afloat, how
much safer they all would have been here.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess if we’d been here, and had seen
the big waves,” suggested Ned, “we’d have gone
in the boats, too. Though with a heavy sea running
I’d hate to trust myself in even a big life
boat.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we go below,” said Jerry. “We may
find some trace of Bob’s uncle and cousin.”</p>

<p>“Will it be safe?” asked the stout lad.</p>

<p>“Safe! Why not?” Ned wanted to know.</p>

<p>“I mean she may suddenly sink while we’re below.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! This steamer, aside from the
wreck of her upper works, and possibly of the
engines, is sound and tight,” declared Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Ned. “She doesn’t
seem to have taken in much water, either. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
steamer would be valuable if we could get her to
port. There’s the cargo, too. It’s a good find for
someone.”</p>

<p>Looking about them, and making sure their airship
was well fastened so that it would not drift
away, the boys and the professor started below.
They were wondering what they would find. But
even in their wildest imaginings they did not dream
of finding what confronted them a moment later.</p>

<p>For, as they started to descend, they heard a
noise from below, and up a companionway came a
voice calling:</p>

<p>“Who’s there? What do you want? I’m in
command here, and I’m going to salvage this
craft. Avast and belay! Who are you, anyhow,
boarding me on the high seas? Who are you?”</p>

<p>The boys started back, and a moment later
there jumped into view a grizzled sailor—who had
been in sole possession of the wrecked ship. He
held a boiler slicing bar in his hand, and he glared,
rather than looked, a welcome at our friends.</p>

<p>“What do you want here?” growled the lone
sailor.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>A QUEER STORY</small></h2>


<p>For a moment the boys did not know what to
do—or what to say. Jerry confessed, afterward,
that he feared the lone sailor might be a lunatic—made
mad by his sufferings in the storm and
wreck—and the tall lad reasoned that it would
hardly be safe even to parley with him. Ned and
Bob also admitted they felt much the same way.
As for Professor Snodgrass, no sooner had he
come aboard, than he saw a new kind of bug, and
so intent was he on its capture that he paid no
further attention to the boys or the sailor, either.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want?” again growled the
latter, advancing in what seemed a menacing way
toward our friends. “Are you trying to get in
ahead of me?”</p>

<p>Jerry was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“We came here to look for friends,” spoke
the tall lad. “We’re not trying to get in ahead
of you, or anything like that. In fact we didn’t
know that you, or anyone, was aboard. We are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
seeking friends—perhaps you can tell us something
about them?”</p>

<p>“Ha! That’s a likely yarn!” sneered the
sailor. “Tell that to the marines! What do you
want here, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I tell you we are looking for friends,” repeated
Jerry. “They are the uncle and cousin of
Bob Baker, here. We are looking for a Mr. Nelson
Sheldon and his daughter Grace, who came
from Germany on this ship. Can you tell us what
became of them?”</p>

<p>At the sound of the names the sailor started.
The iron bar dropped from his hand, and a different
look came over his face.</p>

<p>“Is that true?” he cried. “You’re not stringing
me; are you? Is that a straight yarn?”</p>

<p>“It certainly is,” said Jerry, a trifle stiffly, for
he did not like this talk, nor was he in the habit of
having his word doubted. “We live in Cresville,
not far from Boston. We heard of this wreck—it
was reported by wireless in the papers—and we
came in our airship to see if we could pick up any
survivors, hoping to find Mr. Sheldon and his
daughter among them. We were much surprised
when we saw the steamer still afloat. If you like
you can look over the side and see our aeroplane—the
<i>Comet</i>.”</p>

<p>The man did not answer. But he did do as
Jerry suggested. He went up on deck and looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
over to where the craft of the air floated on the
waves, made fast to the <i>Hassen</i>. Then the sailor,
smiting his thigh with his palm, making a sound
like a pistol shot, cried:</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be hornswoggled! Avast and belay!
Davy Jones himself couldn’t beat this! And
you came out here in that?”</p>

<p>“We surely did,” said Jerry. “Now do you
believe us?”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll have to,” said the sailor. “I ask
your pardon, mates, but you see I’m naturally suspicious.
I’ve been through a deal of hardships,
like, and this is my first chance to make some
money. I’m going to get this ship to port if I can,
and claim salvage.”</p>

<p>“But what about the Sheldons?” asked Bob,
eagerly. “Were they aboard? Are they drowned?
What has become of my uncle and cousin? If
they’re not here we’ll have to go in search of
them.”</p>

<p>“Easy, son, easy!” exclaimed the old sailor, in
gentle tones. “Once more I asks your pardon for
the way I received you folks. I didn’t mean anything
by it. And to think that I acted that way
toward friends of Mr. Sheldon—after all he did
for me! It’s too bad!”</p>

<p>“Then he was here?” asked Bob, eagerly.</p>

<p>“He was, son, he and his daughter. But they’re
not here now—nobody stayed but myself, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
it would have been better for all hands if they had.
The old <i>Hassen</i> is tight yet.”</p>

<p>“But where are they—where is my uncle?”
cried Bob, a little impatient at the man’s long-winded
talk.</p>

<p>“They went off in one of the small boats,” said
the sailor. “Sit ye down, lads, and I’ll tell you all
about it. Sit ye down. Oh, but it’s good to see
friends again! I’ve been lonesome these last days,
just drifting along. Sit down and I’ll spin you the
yarn in proper fashion.”</p>

<p>“We can’t stay long,” said Jerry, foreseeing a
lengthy tale. “If our friends aren’t here we must
go aloft and search for them. They may be suffering.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt but what they are,” returned the
sailor, in a low voice. “They went off in an open
boat, and there wasn’t much time to put water and
provisions aboard. But I won’t keep you long.
I’ll tell you what happened then—at the time of
the storm—and since. Your friends may not be
as far away as you think.”</p>

<p>“Where? Where are they?” cried Bob,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, lad. I’ll tell you, only I have to
do it in my own way,” said the sailor, and Jerry
made his stout chum a sign not to interrupt if he
could help it. That would be so much time gained.</p>

<p>The man told, as briefly as he could, how they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
had sailed from Germany, and had had, until near
the close of the voyage, fine weather. Mr. Sheldon
and his daughter, Grace, were among the
passengers, and the sailor, who gave his name
as Jacob Denton, came to know Bob’s uncle quite
well, from having rendered him a slight service.</p>

<p>Then one day there had been a fire drill, and
the sailor, through some mistake, had been in danger
of severe injury by the slipping of a rope. Mr.
Sheldon, who was standing near him, acted
promptly, and saved him. This made Jacob Denton
very grateful, and it was no wonder that he
regretted the rather surly way in which he had
greeted Bob and his chums.</p>

<p>“But I thought you had come to take away my
right to salvage,” said the sailor. “You know, if
a vessel is deserted, and someone picks it up at
sea, or if he stays aboard, and brings her to port,
he is entitled to salvage—that’s a certain percentage
of her value and the value of the cargo. If I
get mine I’ll never go to sea again.”</p>

<p>“Then I hope you get it,” said Jerry. “But
what happened to Mr. Sheldon and his daughter?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” resumed the sailor. “As I said,
we had good weather, and it looked as though we
would make port without a hitch. Then came the
storm, and everything went wrong.</p>

<p>“For a while our captain held on, and then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
when the wind got worse, we plunged and pitched
about until there was almost a panic among the
passengers. Of course it was a bad storm, but
I’ve seen worse, and I didn’t mind it so much.</p>

<p>“Then came a report that we were sinking, and
a cry to man the small boats. Some water did
come into the engine room, when the ship started
some of her plates, but the bulkhead doors were
closed and there wasn’t really much danger. But
you know how it is when you’re at sea in a storm.
It doesn’t take much water inside a ship to scare
the passengers, and sometimes the crew, too.</p>

<p>“Things went from bad to worse. Then it
really came on to blow hard, and the captain didn’t
know what to do. He saw it would be risky to
launch the small boats, but more water came in,
and the passengers fairly demanded to be set
adrift. So the captain had nothing else to do.</p>

<p>“Some of our small boats were smashed, but we
managed to get the others over the side—them
and some life rafts, and everyone but I took to
them—the captain and crew as well as the passengers.”</p>

<p>“Did Mr. Sheldon and his daughter go?”
asked Bob eagerly.</p>

<p>“They did, son. I helped them stock their
boat, which was one of the small ones. It was No.
7, but it was a good craft, and seaworthy. They
went in that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“And you didn’t go?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“No. Mr. Sheldon wanted me to, but I saw
that he had a couple of good sailors in his boat,
and I said I’d take my chance staying on the old
<i>Hassen</i>. I’m glad now that I did. I wanted more
under my feet in a storm at sea than the inch
planking of a small boat. So I stayed—I wish
the others had, too,” he added in rather gloomy
tones.</p>

<p>“Don’t—don’t you think my uncle has any
chance?” Bob asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, son, a chance—a bare chance. I didn’t
think so until last evening, but I did then.”</p>

<p>“Why then?” asked Jerry curiously.</p>

<p>“Because I saw him again—he and his daughter
in the small boat!” was the unexpected answer.</p>

<p>“You saw them?” cried Bob. “Where?”</p>

<p>“Near this ship. They were drifting about—they’d
lost their oars, I guess, and the current set
them back here. I saw them plainly, but I couldn’t
get to them, and they couldn’t get to me. Then a
fog came up and I lost them. But I saw them
right off there,” and the sailor pointed to the port
side of the wrecked ship.</p>

<p>“Then let’s go in search of them!” cried Bob.
“Come on, Jerry, before it’s too late.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed the tall lad. “Is that
all?” he asked of the sailor.</p>

<p>“About all, lad. After all the boats had gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
off in the storm I stayed aboard here. Plenty of
’em wanted me to come in their boats, but I knew
I’d be safer here. And I was. The storm blew
itself out and—here I am.”</p>

<p>He paused a moment and added:</p>

<p>“Where the others are—who knows? Maybe
Davy Jones.”</p>

<p>“But you think Mr. Sheldon and his daughter
have a chance; don’t you?” asked Jerry quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes, son. They weathered the storm, that’s
sure, for I saw them afterward off to the eastward
in their small boat.”</p>

<p>“Just those two?” Ned wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Just them two. Probably them as was in
with ’em had been washed out, or leaped overboard.
Sometimes they do that in a storm—they
get half-crazed, like. The oars, too, must have
been lost or else Mr. Sheldon would have rowed
over to me. As it was I saw him and his daughter
plainly. They waved to me, and then the fog shut
them out.”</p>

<p>“But we’ve got a chance to save them—and
we’re going to!” cried Bob. “Come on, fellows!”</p>

<p>The old sailor quickly concluded his story.</p>

<p>“When the storm passed,” he said, “I managed
to get steam up in one of the pumping engines,
and I cleaned out the engine room. But one man
can’t work the machinery, so I’m just letting her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
drift. I’m going to get up a bit of a sail, if I can,
to give her steerage way, and then I’ll make for
the nearest port. If I can fetch it my salvage
money will make me rich.”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you better let us take you in our airship,”
suggested Jerry. “We have plenty of
room, and you could hire a tug and get the <i>Hassen</i>
to port more quickly.”</p>

<p>“What! Trust myself in an airship? I guess
not!” cried the old sailor. “I’ll stick here, thank
you just the same. And I hope you find your uncle,
son,” he said to Bob.</p>

<p>“If we do, we’ll come back and get you,” promised
Ned.</p>

<p>“I may be in port ahead of you,” was the sailor’s
answer. “Once I get up a bit of sail I can
make pretty good speed. I’m sorry I was so surly
when you came aboard. I was below, studying out
what to do, and I sure thought I had been boarded
by some parties that wanted to cheat me out of my
prize.”</p>

<p>“We were surprised to find anyone aboard,”
said Jerry. “If you like we’ll help you raise a
sail. I guess we can spare that time.”</p>

<p>“Surely,” said Bob. “Now that we know
about where to look for my uncle it won’t be such
a puzzle.”</p>

<p>A sail was quickly rigged up on one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
stumps of the wireless masts, and then, bidding
the lone sailor good-bye, and promising to look
for him in case they should be successful in their
quest, the boys and Professor Snodgrass boarded
the <i>Comet</i> and prepared to start off.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>THE DRIFTING BOAT</small></h2>


<p>“Queer yarn that sailor told; wasn’t it,” remarked
Ned, when the <i>Comet</i> had soared aloft,
leaving the wreck of the <i>Hassen</i> below on the
heaving billows.</p>

<p>“It was that,” agreed Jerry, “but it’s mighty
lucky we found the ship, and met him. Otherwise
we wouldn’t have known where to look for the
small boat.”</p>

<p>“As it is it’s going to be like looking for a
needle in a haystack,” commented Bob. “I don’t
believe we’ll ever find them. Or, if we do, it will
be—too late!”</p>

<p>“Quit giving us such a correct imitation of
gloom and despair,” exclaimed Jerry. “Go cook
something, Chunky, and you’ll feel better.”</p>

<p>“I guess I will,” agreed the stout lad, with a
smile. “I’m hungry.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” admitted Ned. “We all are. Get
up a good meal, Chunky. It will do us all good!”</p>

<p>It was getting late in the afternoon, for they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
had spent more time aboard the wreck than they
realized. Now they were on the go once more,
seeking the small boat containing Mr. Sheldon
and his daughter.</p>

<p>Off to the eastward sailed the <i>Comet</i> in the
direction indicated by the lone sailor. Jerry kept
his craft far enough down so that there would be
no chance of missing the boat. But from her position
in the air, those aboard the <i>Comet</i> could
easily see even a small object on the surface of the
sea, and thus, in this search, the boys would have
an advantage over a water craft, for the range of
vision of those aboard such a vessel is comparatively
limited.</p>

<p>Jerry sent the motorship about in ever-increasing
circles, and the eyes of one or another of the
boys were constantly directed downward. They
would take no chances of missing the small boat.</p>

<p>“Grub’s ready!” called Bob. “Shall I bring
yours to the pilot house, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“No, I guess we all might as well sit down at
the table and eat in comfort.”</p>

<p>“But we may miss the boat,” objected the stout
lad.</p>

<p>“I’ll start the gas machine, and we’ll stay as
nearly as we can in one place until after we’ve
eaten,” said Jerry. “If the boat drifts within
range we can easily see it through the glass floor.
I’ll work the propellers just enough against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
wind to hold us almost stationary. Get busy on
the gas generator, Ned.”</p>

<p>Soon a hissing in the motor room told them that
the powerful vapor was being made. It would
soon fill the lifting-bags, and the <i>Comet</i> could then
navigate as a dirigible balloon.</p>

<p>Until such time, however, Jerry kept her going
as an aeroplane, watching below for any small
boat.</p>

<p>“It will soon be dark,” Ned remarked.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll start the searchlight,” answered
Jerry. “How about the gas?”</p>

<p>“I guess we’ve got pressure enough.”</p>

<p>“Then fill the containers. I’m anxious to get
at some of Chunky’s grub.”</p>

<p>In a short time the airship floated almost motionless
above the sea, the propellers moving just
enough to overcome the slight wind. Then, needing
no attention on the part of the boys, the <i>Comet</i>
could look after herself while our friends ate.</p>

<p>“Say, this is all to the horse radish!” cried
Ned, as he tasted something which Bob put on his
plate. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“Fried chicken,” answered the stout youth.
“Glad you like it. It’s only canned, of course, but
I seasoned it up, and——”</p>

<p>“It’s dandy!” interrupted Jerry. “Got plenty
of it, Chunky, my boy?”</p>

<p>“You needn’t ever ask Bob that,” mumbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Ned, with his mouth full. “You can always trust
him to cook enough. He’s thinking of himself.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” returned the amateur cook.</p>

<p>With occasional glances through the glass floor
of the dining cabin, the boys finished their meal.
They felt much better after it, and, strangely
enough, more hopeful.</p>

<p>It is wonderful how a satisfied appetite can
make a person feel less gloomy. While before
dinner something may seem impossible of execution,
after a good meal difficulties vanish as if by
magic.</p>

<p>It was so with the motor boys. Of course there
was a certain element of luck, or chance, in their
quest, as there is in anything in this world, but
after Bob’s fine spread they felt that luck was going
to be even more with them in the future than it
had been in the past.</p>

<p>“Are you going to navigate to-night, or just
drift about, Jerry?” asked Ned, as the tall lad
went to the pilot house.</p>

<p>“I think we’ll drift. If we sail we might lose
too much ground and have to come back over it
in the morning. If what the old sailor thought
was true—that Mr. Sheldon has no oars in his
boat—he can’t make any progress himself. He’ll
just have to drift about, at the mercy of the wind
and ocean currents.</p>

<p>“Now the wind that blows him will also blow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
us, so we will be able to go in the same direction.
Of course we can’t count on the ocean currents,
but we’ll just have to take a chance on them. So
I think we’ll keep ourselves up as a dirigible balloon,
and only use the propellers if we find the
wind is getting too strong for us.”</p>

<p>Jerry’s chums agreed with this line of reasoning.
There was no need to appeal to Professor
Snodgrass. He was interested only in his collection
of bugs, and unless there was actual need of
his services he seldom took any share in navigating
the <i>Comet</i>. Just then he was busy trying to capture
a little hopping insect he had seen on the deck.</p>

<p>“Look out!” suddenly cried Ned, as he saw the
little scientist make a grab for the bug in question.
This was on the after deck, around which was only
a light railing, with spaces here and there to minimize
the air pressure. The spaces were large
enough for a man to slip through, and the professor
was in imminent danger of doing this as
he made a dart for the specimen.</p>

<p>Ned, alive to the risk Mr. Snodgrass was taking,
slid toward him, and grabbed him by the feet.
It was only just in time, too, for the professor
might easily have gone overboard, falling a thousand
feet into the sea below.</p>

<p>“Ah, I have him! The beauty!” cried the little
bald-headed man, as he peered between his fingers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
at something held in his hand. “I have the
prize!”</p>

<p>“And I have you!” panted Ned. “Do you
realize that you nearly went overboard?”</p>

<p>“No! Did I really?” asked Mr. Snodgrass.
“It was very good of you to catch me. I just
couldn’t let that prize get away. It is a very rare
specimen of a pink flea.”</p>

<p>“Gracious!” cried Jerry, who had run out of
the pilot house on hearing Ned’s cry. “I hope
there aren’t any more aboard!”</p>

<p>“I wish I could get half a dozen,” said the professor,
as he rose from the deck. “I could sell
them to various museums for a good sum.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you take many more chances like
that,” said Ned with a laugh, “you’ll never get
any more specimens—not even the hermit crabs
you’re after.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll be careful,” promised the scientist.
“I do hope I can get those crabs. Do you think
you boys will be able to manage a submarine when
this trip is over?”</p>

<p>“We’ll see,” said Jerry, non-committally.</p>

<p>They cruised about a little longer, and then, as
darkness came on, the big search-light was set
aglow, making a white illumination on the surface
of the sea. Jerry let the airship sink lower now,
for he realized that to pick up a small boat during
the night would be no easy task. They divided the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
night into watches, as one boy could easily do all
that was required to the motors and engines, and,
at the same time, keep watch out below.</p>

<p>The night passed without incident, save that the
wind sprang up about three o’clock, making it necessary
to work the propellers at a higher rate of
speed to overcome the air currents. Then morning
dawned, but there was no sight, on the heaving
sea, of the small boat they sought. The wreck of
the <i>Hassen</i> had also disappeared below the horizon.</p>

<p>“And as for that submarine,” said Bob, “I
guess that has gone back to Germany.”</p>

<p>“You see how groundless your fears were
about her attacking the vessel your uncle was on,”
spoke Ned. “You’re almost as bad as Andy
Rush, Chunky.”</p>

<p>“Not quite,” said Jerry, with a laugh, defending
his stout chum.</p>

<p>After breakfast they again started circling about,
trying to locate the small boat. Every minute was
precious now, for they all realized that Mr. Sheldon
and his daughter might be suffering greatly
from lack of food and water. They had been in
the open boat for some time.</p>

<p>Noon came, and still no success.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look very hopeful,” said Bob, with
a sigh he could not hide.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re not going to give up yet,” declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Jerry with a confidence he did not altogether feel.
“We’ve got plenty of time yet to find them.”</p>

<p>The afternoon was wearing away. It looked
as though the motor boys would have to spend
another night floating above the sea.</p>

<p>Jerry, who was alone in the pilot house, called
to Ned:</p>

<p>“I say, old fellow, come here a minute. I see
something, but I’ve been staring at it so long that
my eyes are swimming. Take a look and see what
you make of it.”</p>

<p>Ned, with repressed excitement, looked to
where his chum pointed. Then he took an observation
through a powerful glass.</p>

<p>“It’s a small boat, all right,” he spoke finally,
in a low voice, “and it’s drifting about. But
whether it’s the one we are looking for is another
question.”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon see,” returned Jerry, almost in a
whisper. Then he speeded up the motor and headed
the <i>Comet</i> for that small speck on the great
ocean.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>THE SUBMARINE AGAIN</small></h2>


<p>“That’s a boat from the <i>Hassen</i>, all right!”</p>

<p>It was Bob Baker who spoke, and his remark
was made as the airship neared the small craft
heaving up and down on the billows.</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?” asked Jerry, who
was at the wheel of the <i>Comet</i>, directing her
course toward the little boat they had sighted
some time before.</p>

<p>“I can make out the name painted on the bows,”
replied the stout youth, who was peering through
a powerful telescope. “I can see the word ‘<i>Hassen</i>’
as plainly as anything.”</p>

<p>“Can you see anyone in the boat? That’s the
most important thing,” rejoined Ned, who was
standing by, ready to release the hydroplanes
when Jerry should give the word.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t make out anyone,” said Bob, and
his voice was not very hopeful. And then something
of the spirit of his chum seemed to enter his
soul, for he added in more hopeful tones: “But
then, if it’s the boat my uncle and cousin were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
they may be lying down, under a piece of canvas,
or something like that. There’s a mass of something
in the middle of the boat.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to talk!” exclaimed Jerry.
“We’ll just hope they’re in it until we get up to
it and find out they’re not.”</p>

<p>“And, even then,” said Ned, bound to keep up
the work of good cheer, “that may not be the boat
your folks set out in, Chunky. It’s likely there’d
be several lifeboats adrift, and if one of them
hung around in this vicinity, there may be more.
So if they’re not in that we’ll just look for another.”</p>

<p>“That is, providing this isn’t Boat No. 7,”
spoke Bob. “If it is, and they’re not in it——”</p>

<p>He paused suggestively.</p>

<p>“That may not prove anything,” said Jerry
quickly, for he noted the distress that had crept
into Bob’s voice. “That old sailor may have been
mistaken in the number of the boat. In the excitement
aboard a ship supposed to be sinking, when
everyone was anxious to save himself, I don’t see
how he could be quite sure of anything. Well,
we’ll know in another minute or so—know something,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> was quite close to the small boat,
and now, even without the aid of the glass, the
name “<i>Hassen</i>” could be made out on her bow.
And it was also evident that, unless the two shipwrecked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
persons were huddled under a pile of
sail-cloth amidships, they were not in the boat.</p>

<p>“Still, they may be there,” said Ned, hopefully,
with a glance at Bob’s now despondent face.</p>

<p>“Let’s make sure that’s Boat No. 7, first,” suggested
Jerry. “Drop the hydroplanes, Ned!”</p>

<p>In another moment the <i>Comet</i> had alighted on
the surface of the sea, where she rode lightly and
easily, as it was very calm. Then, with the propellers
gently revolving, Jerry sent his craft close
to the small boat.</p>

<p>There came a cry from Bob.</p>

<p>“It is Lifeboat No. 7!” he gasped, pointing to a
small figure under the name, where also appeared
the number of persons the craft was supposed to
carry. “That’s the boat my uncle and cousin were
in,” he added. “But—but, they’re not in it now!”</p>

<p>Truly it did not seem so, for there was no sign
of life in that lonely little boat adrift on the great
ocean. No sound came from it—there was no
stir under that pile of canvas which was spread
over the two middle seats. All was silent—the
silence that meant desertion.</p>

<p>“They may be—asleep,” said Jerry, in a low
voice. “They may be worn out—half exhausted,
and be lying under there. We must go aboard and
look. Get a line ready to make fast, Ned.”</p>

<p>“What’s this. What’s going on,” asked the
voice of Professor Snodgrass, as he came from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
little room where he kept and mounted his specimens.
“Have you found a submarine?”</p>

<p>“Not quite,” answered Ned. “But we think
we have the boat in which Bob’s uncle was—maybe
is yet.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed the little scientist. He had
been so engrossed with making notes about a
strange fly he had caught that he was not even
aware the small boat had been sighted. And the
boys had been too interested to tell him.</p>

<p>The <i>Comet</i> was soon made fast to the small
boat and the two drifted together. It seemed to
be Bob’s right to be the first aboard, and Jerry and
Ned held back, while the stout lad clambered over
the gunwale. He hesitated a second, and then
slowly raised the edge of the canvas. He almost
feared to look at what he might find there.</p>

<p>With a sudden motion, Bob threw back the covering.
Then he started, and gave a quick glance
at his companions.</p>

<p>“They’re not here!” he cried. “There’s nothing
here!”</p>

<p>In a moment Ned and Jerry were at their
chum’s side.</p>

<p>“Is there any evidence that anyone has been
here?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>A look about soon disclosed that the boat had
been occupied, and recently. There were crumbs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of bread about, and a tin cup containing a little
water.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a good sign,” spoke Jerry, in
tones of relief. “They weren’t hungry, or thirsty,
that’s very sure.”</p>

<p>“No, whoever was in this boat had something
to eat,” agreed Bob, and his face was brighter.</p>

<p>“If we could only settle for sure that it was
your folks,” spoke Ned. “That’s a puzzle; as
well as what has become of them. Could they
have fallen overboard?”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” exclaimed Jerry quickly, giving
Ned a nudge, unseen by Bob. “More likely
they’ve been taken off by some other vessel.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, I didn’t think of that!” cried
Ned, quick to take his chum’s hint. “Of course,
that’s it. They saw some other vessel, or some
other ship saw them, and picked them up. Naturally
the rescuing ship wouldn’t stop to take the
boat. That accounts for them not being here; eh,
Bob?”</p>

<p>“I—I hope so,” spoke the stout youth, in a low
voice. “But I wish I could be sure they <em>had</em> been
here. If they had only left some message.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course they didn’t know we were
coming in search of them,” remarked Jerry, with
a laugh, “or they might have done so. But I’m
sure they didn’t fall overboard. All they’d have
to do, even in a big storm, would be to lie down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
in the bottom of this boat, and they’d be safe.
Of course the boat could fill with water——”</p>

<p>“No it couldn’t!” interrupted Ned, quickly.</p>

<p>“Why not?” challenged Jerry.</p>

<p>“Because she’s a self-bailer. Nearly all lifeboats
are, now-a-days. It couldn’t fill.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried the tall lad, with enthusiasm.
“That settles it then. But, as Bob says, it would
be a satisfaction to know whether or not Mr.
Sheldon and his daughter were here.”</p>

<p>Bob was looking about the lifeboat in which the
three lads were sitting. Professor Snodgrass had
remained aboard the <i>Comet</i>, but was watching all
that went on.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ned, who had been gazing about the
small craft, uttered a cry, and sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>For answer Ned stooped and picked up a piece
of white linen. It had lodged under a seat and
was not at first observed.</p>

<p>“Look!” Ned exclaimed. “It’s a lady’s handkerchief!”</p>

<p>Bob uttered a low cry and reached out his hand
for it. It was damp with the spray of the sea,
and as he spread it out a name, marked in one
corner with indelible ink, caught his eye. The
others saw it, too—it was “Grace Sheldon!”</p>

<p>There was no doubt of it now. The Sheldons
had been in that very boat, but they were not there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
now. Had the sea claimed them as its own? Had
they fallen overboard? Or, better thought, had
a passing vessel picked them up?</p>

<p>For a moment the discovery stunned, in a measure,
the motor boys. Bob was especially overcome,
as was but natural. Then Jerry, rallying
to the emergency, said stoutly:</p>

<p>“Look here now. Let’s face this thing right.
There seems to be no doubt that your relatives
were here, Bob. They aren’t here now; but just
stop and think.</p>

<p>“That old sailor on the <i>Hassen</i> saw them the
other night, and they were all right then. And
since he saw them there has been no storm. The
sea has been calm, this boat has not been harmed,
so the only natural conclusion is that Mr. Sheldon
and his daughter have been taken off, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” admitted the stout boy, after considering
the matter. “But who did it? Where are
they?”</p>

<p>“That’s something we can’t tell,” admitted
Jerry frankly. “But I’m positive they are safe.”</p>

<p>“So am I!” exclaimed Ned decidedly.</p>

<p>“And I’m going to hope so,” came from Bob.</p>

<p>There seemed to be now no further use in the
boys remaining in the lifeboat. They had found
out what they wanted to learn, unsatisfactory as
the information was. Bob put in his pocket the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
handkerchief of his cousin—the handkerchief that
had done so much to solve the mystery.</p>

<p>“She must have dropped it when—when she
was getting in the other boat to go aboard the vessel
that took them off,” he said.</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed Jerry. “Well, we may
as well get back on the <i>Comet</i>.”</p>

<p>“Too bad to let this fine boat go adrift, but
there’s no help for it,” murmured Ned.</p>

<p>They were about to go back on their own craft,
when a cry from Professor Snodgrass startled
them.</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” shouted the little scientist.
“A whale! There’s a whale, boys! Oh, if we
could only get closer so that I might make some
observations.”</p>

<p>Jerry stood up on the seat in the lifeboat in
order to see better. And, no sooner had he looked
closely at the object at which the professor pointed
than he cried:</p>

<p>“Whale! That’s no whale. It’s that submarine
again!”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>IN PURSUIT</small></h2>


<p>The excitement caused by Jerry’s announcement
can easily be imagined; and it was of several
sorts. To himself the recognition of the
strange craft that seemed so fated to be linked
with their fortunes proved that the fanatical German
who owned it had not left American waters.</p>

<p>To Ned the discovery was startling enough,
and, for an instant, he had a wild idea that he
would like to interview the captain, and learn
whether it would be possible for himself and his
chums to own a craft like that.</p>

<p>Bob, when he heard Jerry’s cry, thought of his
former fears in regard to the strange craft—fears
that he realized now were somewhat foolish.</p>

<p>As for Professor Snodgrass, no sooner did he
understand what Jerry had said, and no sooner
did he note the glistening metal plates of the
under-water craft, than he cried out:</p>

<p>“Boys, please put over there. This is the very
chance I want. I must go aboard, sink to the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of the sea and try to get one of those hermit
crabs. Jerry, signal him, and ask him to take me
aboard!”</p>

<p>The little scientist was all excitement. Forgotten
was the last strange bug he had been cataloging,
in his desire to fulfill his newest quest.</p>

<p>“Are you sure that is the same submarine,
Jerry?” asked Ned, as the three lads got aboard
the <i>Comet</i> again.</p>

<p>“Of course, I’m not sure it’s the same one we
saw first,” was the answer; “but it’s a submarine,
all the same, and of a similar type. Perhaps it
may be one of Uncle Sam’s fleet. I understand
they are to have some practise out this way soon.”</p>

<p>“There’s no doubt of it being a submarine,”
added Bob. “Did you see it pop up, Professor?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the scientist, “I was looking
over in that direction when I observed a commotion
in the water. I thought at first it was some
big fish, and when it came well up out of the water,
with its rounded back, I made up my mind it was
a whale. But when Jerry called out——”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen her—or one like her—before,” interrupted
the tall lad. “I could make out the overlapping,
riveted plates.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can see them now, quite plainly,”
agreed the scientist. “But, boys, can you possibly
put me aboard?”</p>

<p>“I fancy it depends more on the captain of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
craft than on us,” said Jerry, with a smile. “It
will be easy enough for us to steer the <i>Comet</i> over
there, but whether he’ll let us come aboard is another
question.”</p>

<p>“We might try it,” suggested Ned, who, the
more he thought of it, the more he desired to try
a trip in a submarine.</p>

<p>“All right,” assented Jerry. “I’ve no objections.”</p>

<p>“There doesn’t seem to be much life about it,”
remarked Bob, as he looked toward the strange
craft.</p>

<p>This was very true. The submarine lay on the
surface of the sea, moving slightly with the swell.
And it was such a submarine as the boys had never
seen before, save on that first occasion. There
was not a single projection to mar the outer shell,
which did indeed look like a whale’s back. There
was no conning tower, no periscope tubes, and no
projecting hatchway by which access could be had
to the interior.</p>

<p>Doubtless there was one of these, for entrance
must be made through the top, but it was probably
flush with the deck, or else the hatch, in the form
of a tube, was collapsible and could be raised or
lowered at will.</p>

<p>From their low position, with the <i>Comet</i> on the
surface of the ocean, the boys and Professor Snodgrass
could not see very well, and Jerry, as were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
his chums, was anxious to go aloft whence a better
view could be had.</p>

<p>“There doesn’t seem to be even a flat place for
a deck,” remarked Ned, trying to get a glimpse
of it. “The back of that craft is just like the back
of a fish without a fin sticking up. I don’t see how
those sailors we saw managed to keep their footing
on here.”</p>

<p>“That’s so she can make speed,” spoke Jerry.
“There must be a slightly flattened place somewhere
to allow for getting on and off.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s get in motion, and see if they’ll take
us in,” suggested the professor. “I am exceedingly
anxious to get to the bottom of the sea, and
capture some of those rare crabs.”</p>

<p>“We can try, but I’m not very hopeful,” observed
Jerry, as he remembered how the submarine
had fled before at the sight of the airship.
“They seem very suspicious.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand how they can see us, the
way she is now,” said Ned. “She seems tightly
sealed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s doubtless a way we can’t observe,”
spoke Jerry, as he prepared to send the <i>Comet</i>
aloft.</p>

<p>The submarine lay sullen and motionless on the
surface of the sea. It was like some monster of
the depths that had come up for a breath of air
and would, on the slightest alarm, dive down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the fastness of some ocean cave again. Not a
sign of life was to be observed; not a sound came
from the strange craft. She was the personification
of mystery.</p>

<p>Silently the <i>Comet</i> rose into the air, Jerry having
started the gas generator. He wanted to rise
as a balloon—without a sound—so that he might
not give the alarm to those in the submarine. In
this way they might get close enough to communicate
with the captain or crew.</p>

<p>“But from the looks of that fanatical old German,”
spoke Bob, “I don’t believe he’d give us
a sandwich if we were starving.”</p>

<p>“This may not be the same craft,” observed
Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” admitted Bob, “but she looks
just like the one we saw.” All the boys agreed to
this.</p>

<p>Higher and higher went the <i>Comet</i>, and then
Jerry put in motion the propellers that would send
her over the half-mile of water that intervened between
the air craft and the one from the depths.</p>

<p>As the <i>Comet</i> came nearer and nearer to the
submarine there was still no sign aboard the mysterious
craft that the boys had been observed.
Either their presence was being ignored, or those
aboard the fish-like boat were not aware of it.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do, Jerry?” asked
Ned, a little later, as he noted that they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
right above the submarine. “Are you going to
land on her back?” They could now see a small,
flat deck.</p>

<p>“I don’t know just what to do,” was the puzzled
answer. “I wish they’d give us some sign.”</p>

<p>The boys and the professor were eagerly
watching the submarine. All seemed silent aboard
her.</p>

<p>Suddenly, though, there was a commotion in the
water near what was evidently her stern. There
appeared white foam, and a moment later the
strange craft began to move through the water, in
the position known as “awash,”—that is, with the
deck just showing.</p>

<p>“There she goes!” cried Bob. “She’s seen us
and off she goes!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we’re going after her!” responded
Jerry, fiercely, as he pulled the lever that speeded
up the great propellers. “Boys, we’ll see if we can
solve this mystery. We’ll try to catch this boat
and see what she’s doing over here!”</p>

<p>On shot the <i>Comet</i>, about a hundred feet in the
air, while, down below her, the submarine plowed
through the water. The strange pursuit was
under way.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>A BOLT FROM THE SKY</small></h2>


<p>“Are we gaining on them, Jerry?” asked the
professor eagerly, when the chase had been on
for several minutes.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can easily catch up to them, and pass
them; but that’s just the trouble, I don’t want to
do that,” replied the tall lad. “If we get beyond
them we’d have to turn, and then we might lose
sight of them. I don’t know what to do if they
won’t be friendly and let us come aboard.”</p>

<p>“They could easily fool us by just sinking,”
spoke Ned. “I don’t see why they don’t do that
instead of trying to run away from us on the surface.
If that submarine captain knows anything
about physics he must know that an object can
travel through the air quicker than it can in
water.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Bob, “but he’s going
along at a pretty good clip.”</p>

<p>This was indeed so. The submarine was fairly
flying over the surface of the sea, a smother of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
foam at her stern showing where the propeller, or
whatever form of propulsion she used, was working,
while at her blunt nose was a long ripple as
the water was pushed away on either bow.</p>

<p>“She is certainly making time,” conceded Jerry.
“She must have powerful engines.”</p>

<p>“I guess those aboard her were watching us all
the time,” came from Ned. “They just waited
until they saw us getting too close, and then they
started off.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but what I can’t understand,” observed
Jerry, “is why they don’t dive, if they want to
have us guessing. If she went down, even a few
feet, we couldn’t see her, and she might come up
ten miles from here. Then we would be out of
it.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” admitted Ned. “But perhaps
they had to come up for fresh air, and their tanks
aren’t quite filled yet. Of course oxygen can be
manufactured aboard a submarine, but you can’t
breathe artificial air forever—you’ve got to have
fresh air, especially if they run gasoline engines,
as they probably do, though the main ones may be
operated by electricity from a storage battery.”</p>

<p>“Why do they need so much air for gasoline
engines?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Because gasoline won’t explode unless it’s
mixed with air. The engine simply must have it.
So that’s why they’re probably staying on the surface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
so long—to renew the air in the compression
tanks to feed to the motors.”</p>

<p>On and on rushed the submarine, but there was
no more sign of life from without than there had
been at first. Nor could the boys understand how
they themselves had been observed.</p>

<p>“Well, something will happen, sooner or later,”
said Jerry, as he followed the course of the craft
below them. “And if nothing else does it will be
darkness coming on, so we’ll lose sight of her.”</p>

<p>“What about the search-light?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“That will help some, but this submarine is
about the color of water, anyhow, and it isn’t
going to be the easiest thing in the world to follow
her after dark, even with our powerful light.”</p>

<p>“Oh, boys, I do hope we won’t lose her!” exclaimed
Professor Snodgrass. “I may never have
such a chance again to get in a submarine and look
for those hermit crabs. Don’t lose her if you can
help it.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” answered Jerry, “but it isn’t going
to be easy. Besides, she may, as I said, dive any
minute!”</p>

<p>But at present the submarine seemed to have no
such intention. She spun along through the water,
with the airship following her overhead, Jerry
keeping the speed of his craft at such a point as
would not cause him to over-run the boat.</p>

<p>“Say, we’re forgetting all about my uncle!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
exclaimed Bob at length. “What are we going
to do about him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see that we can do anything, Chunky,
my boy!” exclaimed Jerry. “There’s no doubt
that he and his daughter have been picked up by
some steamer, and they may be in port before we
get back home. In fact, after we try out this submarine
a bit I think the best thing we can do is to
put back to Cresville. I’m sure you’ll find your
uncle and cousin waiting there for you.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I hope so,” returned Bob. “Well,
as long as there’s nothing for me to do, I think
I’ll——”</p>

<p>“Get something to eat!” interrupted Ned.
“Now, don’t get mad, Chunky, I’d like some myself;
how about it, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Yes, go as far as you like in the galley, Bob.
I’ll eat when grub is ready, but just now I’m anxious
to see how this chase is coming out.”</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Ned, suddenly. “I guess this
ends it!”</p>

<p>As he spoke he pointed below. They all looked,
and as they did so they saw the submarine suddenly
sink. Her blunt nose seemed to poke itself beneath
the waves, and in a few seconds all that
showed where the strange craft had been were
some bubbles and foam on the surface of the heaving
sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“She’s gone!” cried the professor, in disappointed
tones.</p>

<p>“I thought she’d do that,” murmured Jerry.
“Well, that settles it as far as we are concerned.”</p>

<p>“You’re not going to give up; are you?” Professor
Snodgrass wanted to know. “I simply
must have a submarine to get those hermit crabs.”</p>

<p>“Well, it will all be a matter of luck, anyhow,
finding this one again,” spoke Ned. “I guess, Professor,
it will be easier for us to build you one, or
buy a second-hand boat, if there are any such.”</p>

<p>“Anything, so as I can get to the bottom of the
sea,” sighed the scientist, still looking at the place
where the mysterious submarine had disappeared.</p>

<p>“Get busy with supper, Bob!” called Jerry, as
he set the automatic steering gear. “There’s nothing
else to do now except eat.”</p>

<p>“And after that?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll hang around here for a few days,
and then, if we don’t see any more of the <i>Hassen’s</i>
lifeboats, with some of the passengers or crew, or
if we don’t sight the submarine once more, I think
we may as well go back home,” replied Jerry.
“Bob will want to see his uncle, and the folks will
get anxious about us if we stay out too long.”</p>

<p>“You seem pretty sure my uncle is safe ashore,”
spoke the stout lad.</p>

<p>“I am,” declared Jerry. “You’ll soon be able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
to satisfy your curiosity regarding that valuable
object he brought over with him.”</p>

<p>“I have been wondering what it could be,” admitted
Bob. “It’s a family secret, I know that
much, and it’s valuable. Well, I may as well get
supper, I suppose,” and he finished his remarks in
such a naive way that Ned and Jerry laughed.</p>

<p>As for Professor Snodgrass, now that his hope
of getting on the submarine was dashed, he went
back to his beloved labor of catching any stray
bugs and insects that might be aboard the <i>Comet</i>,
or which he could net out of the air.</p>

<p>Supper was progressing satisfactorily, various
appetizing odors that came from the galley testifying
to Bob’s activities. Jerry and Ned looked
to see if the machinery was running properly and
then they kept watch down below for a possible
sight of the boat that had eluded them.</p>

<p>But it would soon be too dark to see, and Jerry
decided that the chances of picking up the craft in
the rays of the powerful search-light were too
small to make up for the discomfort that would be
caused by standing watch all night.</p>

<p>“We’ll just let her go, and trust to luck for finding
her again,” he said. “Evidently she is cruising
about in these waters, and the chances are just
as good for finding her again by accident as they
would be if we made a search. Luck goes in
threes, anyhow, you know, fellows. We’ve seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
her twice when we least expected it, and I believe
we’ll see her again. Now I’m going to take it
easy,” and he stretched out on a sofa in the living
cabin, through the glass floor of which glimpses
could be had of the ocean below them.</p>

<p>Preparations for the evening meal were well
under way, and the <i>Comet</i> was shooting along at
good speed. The boys were thinking of many
things. Ned and Jerry were wondering if it
would be possible for them to get a submarine,
while Bob, during such time as his attention was
taken from his cooking, was wondering if his
uncle and cousin were safely home, and what it
was Mr. Sheldon had brought from Germany.</p>

<p>Suddenly from the bow of the ship, where Professor
Snodgrass had gone to look for specimens,
there came a cry of pain. Ned and Jerry leaped
to their feet.</p>

<p>“What is it?” cried the tall youth, running forward.</p>

<p>“Have you caught something?” asked Ned
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Ha! It would be more correct to say that
something has caught me!” returned the professor.
“Hurry, boys, it’s a great big beetle, and
he’s pinching me. I daren’t knock him off because
I want him for a specimen. Oh, how he pinches!”</p>

<p>The two chums saw a comical sight—or, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
would have been funny had it not been for the look
of pain on the face of the scientist.</p>

<p>He stood near the pilot house, an insect net
under one arm, and a cyanide bottle—for painlessly
killing his specimens—under the other. His
left hand was tightly closed, while, dangling from
the other was a large, black and squirming bug,
that seemed to be hanging on by the simple process
of making his pincers meet in the flesh of the professor’s
thumb.</p>

<p>“Oh, boys! Take him off! He is hurting me
dreadfully!” cried the scientist. “But be very
careful, as he is a most rare and valuable specimen.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you take him off yourself—you
know how to handle those creatures,” suggested
Ned, who did not much fancy plucking off the vicious-looking
black beetle.</p>

<p>“I—I can’t,” said the professor. “I have a
new kind of upper-air fly in this other hand, and
if I open it he’ll get away. I had caught that, and
was reaching for the beetle, when he pinched me.
I’m glad he’s holding on, though, for it will give
you a chance to get him.”</p>

<p>“Uh—I don’t know as I want to,” replied Ned,
hanging back. “He might transfer his affections
to me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please get him!” begged the scientist.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you how,” said Jerry. “Let me get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
that cyanide bottle from under your arm, Professor.
I’ll open it and hold it near the beetle. The
fumes will stupefy him, and he’ll drop in. Then
I can cork him up.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Professor Snodgrass.</p>

<p>Jerry took the poison bottle, which contained in
the bottom plaster of Paris, mixed with the deadly
cyanide of potassium. The fumes of this are deadly
to all insects in a very short time, killing them
without pain.</p>

<p>Holding the open bottle close under the beetle
that was clinging to the professor’s thumb, but
taking care to keep his own face well away from
the vial, Jerry waited. In a few seconds the pincers
of the beetle relaxed. A few seconds more
and it fell off into the wide-mouthed bottle. Jerry
quickly corked it up, and handed it to the professor.</p>

<p>“Ah, thank you, my boy, thank you!” exclaimed
the scientist. “That is a very rare specimen. I
am glad to get it.”</p>

<p>“As glad as he was to get you,” said Jerry with
a smile. “It certainly is a large beetle.”</p>

<p>“And he certainly pinched,” murmured the professor,
rubbing his thumb, on which were a few
drops of blood. “I think I had better use a little
peroxide to avoid infection.”</p>

<p>This excitement over, supper was served. As
they all stood on the main deck, with darkness settling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
down, Jerry, looking over to the west, while
the motorship moved slowly along, remarked:</p>

<p>“I think we’re in for a storm. I saw a flash of
lightning just then.”</p>

<p>“Bur-r-r-r!” exclaimed Ned with a little shiver.
“I don’t fancy a blow in this exposed place.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess we can weather it,” spoke Jerry.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, I’m glad my uncle and cousin are not
out in an open boat,” added Bob.</p>

<p>Jerry’s prophecy of a storm was borne out. It
came up rapidly and soon there was quite a gale of
wind, while the lightning flashes grew more and
more frequent. The accompanying thunder roared
alarmingly.</p>

<p>It grew darker rapidly, and the storm seemed
likely to last through the night. Rain began to
fall, but the boys did not mind that.</p>

<p>Everything was made snug aboard the craft,
which scudded along through the blackness of the
night, illuminated by the flashes from the sky.</p>

<p>“I wonder where that submarine is now?” said
Bob musingly.</p>

<p>“Probably far down beyond the influence of the
waves,” answered Jerry.</p>

<p>It must have been about midnight, when none of
those on the <i>Comet</i> had cared to turn in that, following
several slight flashes, there came one of
vivid brilliancy. There was that same crackling
sound at first, as the boys had noticed once before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and then a terrific crash, that seemed to split right
through the airship.</p>

<p>In an instant the hum of the propeller motor
ceased, and the benumbed boys and Professor
Snodgrass, unable to move for a second, so paralyzing
had been the shock, felt the craft sinking
with them toward the ocean.</p>

<p>“We’ve been struck!” cried Jerry. “We’re
disabled!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we’re going down!” yelled Ned.</p>

<p>Down and down went the crippled <i>Comet</i>, down
through the storm that was crashing all around
her.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>THE “SONDERBAAR”</small></h2>


<p>Jerry, whom the shock of the lightning bolt
had knocked to one side, jumped for the lever of
the elevating rudder, hoping, if nothing else could
be done, to cause the <i>Comet</i> to volplane more
easily to the surface of the sea. At the same time
he called out:</p>

<p>“The hydroplanes, Ned! Set them quick! Bob,
see if the gas generator is working! There’s something
wrong!”</p>

<p>“It’s cracked!” shouted Professor Snodgrass,
getting up from where he had been thrown against
a locker. “The generator is cracked right across,
Jerry!”</p>

<p>“Then we can’t depend on that!”</p>

<p>There was a look almost of despair in Jerry’s
eyes, but he was not going to give up yet. In a
flash he threw over the switch that connected the
storage battery with the propeller motor.</p>

<p>But there was not even a spark to show that the
electric current was available.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not an ampere!” groaned Jerry. “Everything
is dead!”</p>

<p>The entire electrical equipment of the <i>Comet</i>
had been disabled by the bolt from the sky. She
was as helpless as a collapsed balloon. No gas
could be generated to fill the lifting-bags, and the
small supply that was already in them had leaked
out through rents caused by the lightning. It was
the worst accident that had ever befallen the boys,
and they had been in dire straits often enough.</p>

<p>Down the motorship was plunging toward the
sea that seemed eagerly awaiting her.</p>

<p>“It’s all up with us, I guess!” shouted Ned.
“Can you do anything, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Volplane down—that’s about all. But something
seems to be wrong. I’m afraid some of our
side planes are split. We are falling so fast that
it shows they’re not helping to keep us up.”</p>

<p>A glance at the barograph height gage on the
wall of the pilot house showed the hand to be moving
swiftly around, indicating how fast the <i>Comet</i>
was falling.</p>

<p>“The hydroplanes will keep us afloat a little
while,” said Jerry in a tense voice, as he looked
about as if for some other means of averting the
disaster that was about to overtake them. “But
I’m afraid it’s so rough down there we won’t float
long. The pontoons will be wrenched off by the
waves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then we’d better get on our bathing suits!”
put in Bob, with grim humor.</p>

<p>“You mean life preservers, Chunky!” cried
Ned. “And that’s a good stunt, too. I’ll get
them out.”</p>

<p>Ever since the motor boys had arranged their
craft to navigate over water they had carried life
preservers aboard, and it was the work of only
a few seconds for Ned to get them out.</p>

<p>“Here, Professor!” he called to the scientist,
who was nervously packing up his collection of
specimens, as though he could take them with him;
“here, put on one of these. We may have to swim
for it!”</p>

<p>“We’ll be lucky if we can swim,” muttered
Jerry.</p>

<p>Fortunately, when the <i>Comet</i> was struck by the
bolt of lightning she had been well up in the air,
and now, as she began to fall, there was a considerable
distance for her to go. This gave the boys
and Professor Snodgrass a little time to prepare
for whatever fate had in store for them.</p>

<p>There were looks of despair on all their faces,
for not only did they fear for their lives, but it
was heart-breaking to know that their fine craft
had to meet such an end. And there seemed no
way of saving her.</p>

<p>Plunging down toward the ocean as she was,
about to be engulfed far from the shore, there appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to be no hope for her. In the semi-darkness
of the cabin the motor boys looked at one another.
All the electric lights had been put out by
the shock, and only one emergency oil lamp, always
kept going in anticipation of some accident,
gave illumination.</p>

<p>Once more Jerry tried to start the propellers, so
that he might guide the craft upward, but there
was no power. He had hoped that perhaps the
storage battery might have been only temporarily
polarized, but this was not the case. It was
“dead.”</p>

<p>“I guess we’re in for it,” murmured the tall
lad. “Better get outside, boys,” he went on.
“She may go all to pieces when we strike, and we
don’t want to get tangled up in the wreckage. Get
out on the main deck, and stand ready to jump
clear. We can float for some time in the life preservers,
and in the morning a steamship may pick
us up. It’s our only chance.”</p>

<p>It was still raining hard, but the storm did not
seem to be quite as severe as at first. There were
many flashes of lightning, and the thunder still
rolled and crashed about, but after that one terrific
stroke the elements seemed to be satisfied with
the damage they had wrought, and were now subsiding.</p>

<p>When a particularly bright and far-illuminating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
flash came Jerry looked down through the glass
cabin floor.</p>

<p>“Only a few seconds left!” he cried, as he saw
the waves of the ocean close to them. “Come on
out, boys. Professor, I’m afraid you’ll have to
leave your specimens.”</p>

<p>“Never!” cried the brave little scientist. “I’ll
take them with me, or——”</p>

<p>It was no time for ceremony. Jerry took hold
of his scientific friend, who had consented to don
a life preserver, and fairly carried him out on the
deck. Fortunately the <i>Comet</i> had assumed an
even keel after her first sickening plunge, so the
boys could move about unhampered.</p>

<p>They all reached the deck in safety, and not a
moment too soon. A second later and with a splash
that sent a shower of spray high into the air, the
<i>Comet</i> landed on the surface of the sea.</p>

<p>There was a crash—a sound of splitting and
rending wood—then a silence.</p>

<p>“We struck something!” cried Ned. “We
sure hit something as we came down, Jerry! What
was it?”</p>

<p>No one could tell, for the lone lamp in the cabin
had fallen and gone out. But when the next
lightning flash came the boys, who were standing
near the rail, ready to jump, saw some dark object,
setting low in the water. One of their hydroplanes
had hit it, and had broken off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s a raft!” cried Bob. “Fellows, we’ve
landed on a raft! Of all the luck!”</p>

<p>“Quick then!” shouted Ned. “Get aboard it.
The <i>Comet</i> is sinking!”</p>

<p>Indeed it did seem so. The gallant craft of the
air, caught crippled as she was in the grip of the
sea, was fast settling in the water.</p>

<p>“I guess we’d better take to the raft,” said
Jerry, mournfully. “Oh! if we only had a good
light, and could see what we are doing we might
save her yet! The sea isn’t as rough as I
thought!”</p>

<p>As if in answer to his plea there seemed to come
from the centre of that dark mass they had struck—a
raft, as Bob thought—a soft glow of radiance,
that seemed to spread all about them.</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Ned. “That’s no raft! See
the riveted plates. Boys, it’s the submarine again!
Three times and out. We’ve landed on the deck
of that mysterious submarine!”</p>

<p>“By Jove you’re right!” yelled Jerry. “Fellows,
it’s our only chance. Jump over there, and
pound for all you’re worth. They’ve got to take
us in before they sink, or we’ll go down in the suction.
Jump and pound! It’s our last chance. The
<i>Comet</i> is going down!”</p>

<p>Ned and Bob lost no time in obeying. Part of
the wrecked motorship rested on the deck of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
submarine. So it was easy for the boys and the
professor to make the change.</p>

<p>And it was from this deck that the strange radiance
came—a glow, as the boys could see, from
beneath some thick glass bullseye.</p>

<p><a href="#image03">Quickly the four sprang to the deck of the submarine.</a>
As they did so the <i>Comet</i>, relieved of
their weight, rose slightly but almost immediately
sank lower in the water.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 381px;">

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_136">QUICKLY THE FOUR SPRANG TO THE DECK OF THE SUBMARINE.</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Pound—make a racket!” cried Jerry. “Make
them hear us and take us in. It’s our only
chance!”</p>

<p>Ned and Bob kicked with their heels on the
steel plates that formed the deck. Jerry made his
way to the glass which covered the light, and
rapped on that with his knife. At the same time
he looked around for the hatchway by which admittance
could be gained to the interior of the mysterious
vessel.</p>

<p>Even while he was looking for it—and not seeing
it—there was a noise almost at his feet. It
was the sound of steel moving on steel, and an
opening appeared, flush with the deck. It was a
round opening, large enough to admit a man, and
framed in it was the face of the same white-bearded
and snowy-haired commander they had seen on
the submarine when the boys had had their first
view of her.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it? Why have you dared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
board my vessel without being invited?” growled,
rather than asked the man, speaking with a strong
German accent. “What do you want?”</p>

<p>“To save our lives!” exclaimed Jerry, talking
rapidly. “Our airship was struck by lightning,
and disabled. We fell into the ocean, fortunately
for us, landing partly on your submarine.”</p>

<p>“Ach! So!” exclaimed the German, in surprise.</p>

<p>“And you can’t refuse to take us in,” went on
Jerry. “We will pay you for your time and
trouble—if you wish. We appeal to you for help.
Surely you’ll take us in.”</p>

<p>The commander seemed to hesitate.</p>

<p>“As one scientist to another I appeal to you!”
broke in Professor Snodgrass. “I am connected
with several museums, and I am a member of several
societies to which you, no doubt, belong. You
may have heard of me,” and he mentioned his
name.</p>

<p>“Ach! So!” exclaimed the German again.</p>

<p>“The <i>Comet</i> is sinking!” cried Ned, who was
watching their beloved airship.</p>

<p>“The <i>Comet</i>! Are you from the <i>Comet</i>?”
asked the commander of the submarine quickly.</p>

<p>“We are,” answered Jerry, wondering what
that had to do with it.</p>

<p>“Then I invite you aboard my vessel. Welcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
to the <i>Sonderbaar</i>!” came the quick answer.
“I heard something strike my deck, and came up
to see what it was. Will you not come below?”
and he stepped down out of the way, affording a
passage to Jerry and his friends.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>A GLAD SURPRISE</small></h2>


<p>For a moment Jerry hesitated, but for a moment
only. He realized that this was the only
means of salvation for himself and his friends,
and, though there was a suspicion that the commander
of the submarine was perhaps a vindictive
crank, there was no choice. So Jerry started
down the iron stairs that led into the interior of
the vessel.</p>

<p>“One moment, please,” said the commander,
“you’ll not need your life preserver here. It takes
up too much room, and we have not much to spare.
We have to utilize every inch in a submarine. Besides,
I have preservers of my own. Kindly discard
it, if you please.”</p>

<p>Jerry did so, calling to his companions to do
the same. Then, taking a last look at the <i>Comet</i>,
he went down the hatchway.</p>

<p>The others followed, Professor Snodgrass being
the last to go down. And as he entered the
hole that led into the boat Ned, who was just
ahead of him, heard him say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, that lovely black beetle. I have lost him.
Oh, what a calamity.”</p>

<p>“Better lose him than your life,” commented
Ned. “And we couldn’t have stayed aboard the
<i>Comet</i> another minute. It’s too bad we had to desert
her. Dear old <i>Comet</i>! There’ll never be
another like her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she served us well,” spoke the scientist.
“But perhaps all is for the best. At least I am in
a submarine, and now I may get those crabs. Yes,
I’m sure everything is for the best,” and he seemed
quite resigned to the change.</p>

<p>The four had descended into a plainly furnished
room at the foot of the companionway leading to
the opening in the deck. As soon as the Professor
was standing beside the three boys the German
stepped to where several levers and wheels were
set into the wall, and moved a small handle. Immediately
a grinding sound was heard overhead,
the sliding of steel on steel, and the refugees realized
that the hatch-cover was closed—hermetically
sealed, of necessity. They were bottled up in the
submarine, and with a strange man of whom they
knew little.</p>

<p>“But there must be others,” reasoned Jerry.
“He can’t run this all alone, and his crew can’t all
be as crusty as he seems to be. I guess we’ll be
all right. Anyhow, it’s all we could do—come
aboard her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>The aged commander turned and faced his
guests.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” he said, “I had better ask your
names, and then I will tell you all that is necessary
to know about myself—and my vessel.”</p>

<p>Jerry responded to the implied request by giving
the names of his companions and himself. He also
briefly related their object in being so far to sea
in their airship, and told how they were practically
assured of the safety of Mr. Sheldon and his
daughter. They had intended to return home in a
day or so, but the bolt of lightning had wrecked
their craft.</p>

<p>“And you thought to have a little sport in chasing
me; eh? Did you not?” asked the German
gruffly.</p>

<p>“Well, we meant no harm,” said Jerry, in some
confusion. “To tell you the truth we are much
interested in submarines. We had some idea of
getting one of our own, and we wanted to talk to
you about it.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said the German, a little mollified. “I
have a wonderful craft here, even though I invented
her myself. Allow me to tell you my name.
I am Dr. Emanuel Klauss, of Hamburg, and
I——”</p>

<p>“I have heard of you!” interrupted Professor
Snodgrass, eagerly, while Ned looked at his chums<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
as much as to say: “This is the man I was telling
you about.”</p>

<p>“Are you not the inventor of the Klauss refracting
microscope?” went on Professor Snodgrass.
“That instrument which has been such an invaluable
aid to the proper study of insect life. Are you
that Dr. Klauss?”</p>

<p>“I am,” was the answer, “but I count that
among the least of my achievements. I am devoting
all my time now to submarines.” He did
not seem ill-pleased that his fame was known to
one he had strangely picked up at random out of
the sea.</p>

<p>“This boat has only recently been completed,”
went on Dr. Klauss, “and I am giving it a severe
test. You have seen me before, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Twice before,” replied Jerry with a smile.
“We were just saying that there must be one
more, for luck goes in threes.”</p>

<p>“Bah! I have no use for luck!” exclaimed the
German, snapping his fingers. “But I must not
forget that you are my guests. As I said, we have
not too much room aboard, but I will try to make
you comfortable. First you will want dry garments.
I think some of my crew are small enough
so that their clothes will fit you—temporarily, at
least,” and he glanced at stout Bob.</p>

<p>“If you could arrange to stand by our craft
until morning,” spoke Jerry, eagerly, “we might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
get some of our things off her. I think she will
keep afloat until then.”</p>

<p>“I shall be far away from here in the morning,”
said Dr. Klauss, coldly. “It is impossible for me
to grant your request. I am sorry, but you will
have to make the best of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we don’t want to put you out,” returned
Ned, “and we realize that it was providential of
you to be here at all and save us. I guess we’ll just
have to stand our loss—that’s all.”</p>

<p>“And my specimens!” exclaimed the professor.
“It is too bad that I could not get my black beetle;
but there was such confusion I could not find him.
However, I am glad to be with you, Dr. Klauss. I
think we shall be mutually helpful. Tell me—can
you go to the bottom of the sea in your vessel?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I have been there several times—of
course not in the deepest part, but at a good
depth.”</p>

<p>“And have you diving dress—any arrangement
for getting out of here to the very sea bottom itself?”
asked the scientist eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, that can be done. But——”</p>

<p>“Then it is all right,” interrupted Professor
Snodgrass, with a sigh of contentment. “I shall
be able to get my hermit crabs, and when I do, and
write a monograph on them I shall, in it, acknowledge
my indebtedness to you, my dear Dr.
Klauss.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“Humph!” exclaimed the crusty German, and
he did not seem any too well pleased with the intended
honor.</p>

<p>“Then you can’t stand by the wreck of our
craft until morning?” asked Jerry, with a last
hope. “I don’t mean to save her, but merely to
allow us to get off some of our possessions.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say I cannot,” was the answer.
“I should be on my way now. I merely came to
the surface to replenish my air supply. That will
be completed in a few minutes, and then we will go
below.”</p>

<p>“Under the ocean?” queried Bob, with a gasp.</p>

<p>“Certainly under the ocean. Are you afraid?”</p>

<p>“No—no. Only it’s our first experience.”</p>

<p>“Not that we mind,” put in Ned. “We were
going to take up submarine traveling next, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” exclaimed the German. “Well, I
do not mind showing you about my craft. There
are some secrets, of course, but I am not afraid of
you finding them out. I think you will enjoy seeing
the workings of the <i>Sonderbaar</i>.”</p>

<p>“I am sure we shall,” said Jerry, wondering if
Dr. Klauss was always so grouchy.</p>

<p>“Now to get you more comfortable,” went on
the German commander. “If you will come with
me I will see if my men cannot fit you out with dry
garments.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>He opened a sliding door that led from the
compartment, which seemed to be as much a reception
room as anything else. At once a wonderful
sight was revealed to the boys.</p>

<p>They stood in a long passageway that ran
lengthwise of the craft, amidships. At one end
could be seen a glittering array of machinery, at the
sight of which Jerry’s heart beat with delight. Between
them and the engine room could be seen
other compartments, evidently living, sleeping and
dining quarters.</p>

<p>Forward were other pieces of apparatus, tanks
for the storage of air, other tanks for the holding
of water ballast and at the extreme bow was the
pilot house, the walls of which were a maze of
wheels, gears, levers, switches and controls.</p>

<p>Just aft of the pilot house there seemed to be a
main cabin, and in this, seated at a table, on which
were spread books and papers, sat a man and a
girl. A soft light glowed over their heads, revealing
their features clearly.</p>

<p>And, at the sight of them Bob Baker uttered a
cry—a cry of surprise and joy.</p>

<p>“My uncle!” he exclaimed, starting forward.
“My Uncle Nelson Sheldon, and my Cousin
Grace! How in the world did they get here? I—I——”</p>

<p>But words failed Bob, while his chums were
also too stunned to be able to say anything.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>UNDER WATER</small></h2>


<p>At the sound of Bob’s voice the man and girl
at the table started to their feet, and gazed in the
direction of our friends. But because the latter
were in comparative darkness, while the light
shone brightly in the cabin, the features of the
boys and Professor Snodgrass could not be made
out. As a matter of fact Mr. Sheldon would not
have known anyone but Bob, anyhow, since he had
never seen the two chums.</p>

<p>“Uncle Nelson—Uncle Nelson!” called Bob.
“And Cousin Grace! Is it possible?”</p>

<p>“Who—who are you?” asked Mr. Sheldon,
sharply.</p>

<p>“Your nephew, Bob Baker,” was the answer.
“How in the world did you get here? We’ve been
looking all over for you.”</p>

<p>“You looking for us?” asked Mr. Sheldon,
while Grace gasped in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Yes; ever since we heard of the <i>Hassen</i> being
wrecked. We were looking for you in our airship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the <i>Comet</i>, and we found the steamer—it
didn’t sink after all. Then we found the small
boat you had been in, but it was empty. We
thought——”</p>

<p>“We were picked up by Dr. Klauss,” interrupted
Mr. Sheldon, as he came forward to greet
his nephew. “It was providential, as we had no
means of progressing, and our food and water
were about gone. But how did you get here, and
who are your friends?”</p>

<p>“Our airship was struck by lightning a little
while ago,” Bob explained briefly, “and we fell
down, almost on top of this submarine. Dr.
Klauss took us in.”</p>

<p>“He seems to be in the rescuing business,” said
Grace, with a smile, but Jerry thought he detected
a look of fear on her face as her eyes looked toward
the German inventor.</p>

<p>“This is Professor Snodgrass,” went on Bob,
motioning to the little scientist, “and these are my
best chums—Jerry Hopkins and Ned Slade. You
must have heard of them, Uncle Nelson.”</p>

<p>“Of course I have!” exclaimed the gentleman,
cordially.</p>

<p>“And so have I,” added Grace, with a welcoming
smile. “Oh, how good it is to meet you all
this way—and in such a strange way!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is quite a coincidence,” agreed Dr.
Klauss, and though he smiled there was no warmth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
in it—rather it was cold and calculating. “You
mentioned that you had a nephew of an inventive
turn of mind,” he said to Mr. Sheldon, “and you
spoke of his airship—the <i>Comet</i>. As soon as you
boys named the craft,” he said to Jerry, “I realized
that I had a surprise in store for you. But I
decided to let you find it out for yourselves.”</p>

<p>“And now for more detailed explanations,” remarked
Mr. Sheldon. “I expect all our friends
think we are drowned, Bob?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so. But they’ll soon know differently.
We can send them word.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” said Mr. Sheldon
in a low voice, as Dr. Klauss stepped back a moment,
evidently to communicate with one of his
crew. “Bob,” went on his uncle in a low, tense
voice, “we’re in a peculiar position here. We’re
practically prisoners of a madman aboard this
submarine. He won’t set us ashore, nor put us on
some other vessel. I don’t know what to do. But
I’m glad you and your friends are here. Perhaps
we can find some way of escape.</p>

<p>“Hush! Don’t say anything now! Don’t
show that I have told you anything. Here he
comes back. Act naturally. Yes, as I was saying,
Bob, I’m very glad to see you,” and Mr.
Sheldon spoke the last in loud tones.</p>

<p>Poor Bob, not much used to plotting and planning,
did not know what to do. Fortunately, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
he realized the necessity for acting as though
he had not just heard startling news. Jerry and
Ned had seen that something was wrong, but they
gave no sign. As for Professor Snodgrass, he was
busy looking around the main cabin, where they
had all assembled, in search of any stray bugs.
He took no part in the talk then.</p>

<p>“Dr. Klauss was very kind to take us off our
lonely little boat,” went on Mr. Sheldon.</p>

<p>“How did it happen?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“It was a mere accident,” said the German. “I
had come up to renew my supply of air, and one
of my men saw the small boat. Out of curiosity
I went up to it, and found your friends.”</p>

<p>“And we were almost in despair,” said Grace.</p>

<p>“Oh, those few days were awful! Awful!”
and she covered her eyes with her hands as though
to shut out the sight and memory of what she and
her father had passed through.</p>

<p>“You would have done better had you stayed
on the <i>Hassen</i>, Uncle Nelson,” said Bob. “We
found her afloat, and in good condition. That sailor
said he was going to stick to her.”</p>

<p>“Good old Jacob Denton!” cried Grace. “He
was very kind to us. We wanted him to come in
our boat, but he would not.”</p>

<p>“What happened after you took to the lifeboat?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“We drifted about at the mercy of the storm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
for a long time,” replied Mr. Sheldon. “Then we
lost our oars—one pair was tossed overboard by a
sailor who became crazed, and who leaped into the
sea himself. Then the two other sailors, seeing a
larger boat, jumped over the side to swim to her,
using the other pair of oars as buoys. They
reached her, and that left Grace and me alone.</p>

<p>“Gradually we lost sight of the other boats,
and, having no way of propelling our craft, we
had to drift. We had some food and water, which
we used as sparingly as we could. We took shelter
under the canvas at night, and just drifted—drifted.
Oh, it was terrible! I want to forget it!
Sometimes we would sight a vessel, but we could
not seem to make anyone aboard see us. They
did not come near enough.</p>

<p>“Then, when we were giving up in despair, we
saw what seemed to be a whale approaching.
Grace was very much frightened, fearing it was
going to attack us. I was alarmed, too, but it
proved to be this submarine. We were glad, indeed,
to be taken aboard,” and he smiled at Dr.
Klauss, who was looking sternly at his visitors,
his arms folded, and standing erect, like a man
posing for his statue.</p>

<p>“And so here we are,” concluded Mr. Sheldon,
“but as if <em>our</em> rescue was not enough, here you
boys come and are saved in the same way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“And in the nick of time, too,” added Jerry,
gratefully.</p>

<p>“It was most fortunate for me,” said Professor
Snodgrass, who had not been successful in finding
any specimens, “very fortunate, for I need a submarine
to enable me to get some hermit crabs
from the bottom of the sea.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sheldon looked at Bob inquiringly, as
though to ask if the scientist was altogether right
in his mind.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s always getting specimens,” explained
the stout lad in a low voice, as Mr. Snodgrass
went off in a hurry to get a green fly he saw crawling
on the wall. “He’d go to the moon for a rare
bug—if he could get there.”</p>

<p>“I see,” exclaimed Mr. Sheldon, with a laugh.
“We all have our peculiarities.”</p>

<p>Bob wanted very much to ask his uncle what it
was he had brought over from Germany with him,
but the presence of Dr. Klauss deterred him. The
youth realized that perhaps it was a secret that it
would not be well to share with the strange commander
of the <i>Sonderbaar</i>. And, too, Bob wanted
to hear more about what his uncle had said as to
their being prisoners. If the Sheldons were detained
on board the boys and Professor Snodgrass
would probably be in the same plight.</p>

<p>“There’s something queer here,” mused Bob.
“I’ll have to talk it over with Jerry and Ned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you will excuse me for a little while,” said
Dr. Klauss, rather stiffly, “I will see if we have air
enough. I will also send you some dry clothing,”
he added to the boys, for they had been drenched
by the rain.</p>

<p>“How did you know the open boat you found
was the one we had been in?” asked Grace of her
cousin.</p>

<p>“Because of this,” Bob answered, holding out
her handkerchief. “It has your name on it. But
when we saw that no one was in the boat we
feared, for a time, that you might have been
drowned.”</p>

<p>“I was sure you had been picked up,” put in
Jerry, “and I was right.”</p>

<p>“In a way, yes,” admitted Mr. Sheldon.
“Though, more properly speaking, we were
‘picked down,’ for we had to go down to get into
this boat. And we’ve been under water several
times since.”</p>

<p>“Have you really navigated under water?”
asked Ned with interest.</p>

<p>“Of course,” replied Grace. “At first I was
horribly afraid, but now I don’t mind it very
much.”</p>

<p>There was a sudden click, at which they all
started, and the light went out. At the same time
there was a queer lunging to the vessel. She seemed
to be trying to stand on her bow’s end. Then on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
either side of the cabin appeared a glow of light,
and the boys could see steel shutters sliding back
from heavy plate glass windows.</p>

<p>Then, as the light near these windows increased,
the motor boys found themselves gazing out into
the sea, illuminated in some strange manner by
hidden electric lamps on the side of the submarine.
They could see fishes swimming about.</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Grace, clutching Bob by the
arm, “we are under water now! The <i>Sonderbaar</i>
is going to the bottom of the sea!”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>A MARVELOUS BOAT</small></h2>


<p>So many new and strange sensations had crowded
on the motor boys in the last few days that it
hardly needed the additional one of traveling in a
submarine to thrill them. Nevertheless the three
lads did feel strange as they stood there in the
half-darkened cabin, and looked at the greenish
water slipping past the thick plate-glass side windows—windows
illuminated in such a way that the
very life of the sea was visible.</p>

<p>“Look—look!” exclaimed Bob, in a low voice.
“See that shark!”</p>

<p>And indeed, at that moment, a great sand shark
that was keeping pace with the marvelous boat
looked in through the glass window, as if to ask
what manner of sea companion he had fallen in
with.</p>

<p>“Oh—oh!” cried Grace, as she clutched her
father’s arm. “Suppose that window should
break!”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to suppose anything like that,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
spoke Jerry solemnly. “It’s too—too unpleasant.
Oh, but this is wonderful—wonderful!”</p>

<p>“It’s the greatest thing ever!” declared Ned
with conviction. “I never dreamed we should
ever see anything like this. <a href="#image01">Oh, there’s another
shark—a hammer-head</a>,” and the hideous creature,
with its bulging eyes on projections that give
it the name, resembling a double-ended hammer,
swam up, also to peer in at the windows.</p>

<p>“Wonderful—wonderful,” murmured Professor
Snodgrass. “This will just suit my purpose.
I must have a talk with Dr. Klauss, and arrange
to have him take us on a long trip. I will not
only be able to get my hermit crabs, but I can make
many other valuable discoveries. Science will be
greatly the gainer by our accidental finding of this
submarine. Yes, I hope this trip will be a long
one.”</p>

<p>“You are not likely to be disappointed in that,
sir,” observed Mr. Sheldon, and there was in his
tone such a peculiar meaning that Bob asked:</p>

<p>“Why do you say that, Uncle Nelson?”</p>

<p>“Because it’s true. This man—hush, here he
comes now. I can’t tell you any more at present.
We must have a talk together, presently.”</p>

<p>The sound of someone coming along a steel-floored
passage warned them to talk in low tones.</p>

<p>“But what does it all mean?” asked Jerry, in
bewilderment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, we don’t know—we can hardly guess,”
spoke Grace in his ear. “Papa will tell you. I
can only say that this Dr. Klauss, in spite of his
seeming politeness, is a terrible man. I’m so glad
you boys are with us. Perhaps now we can
escape!”</p>

<p>“Escape!” gasped Jerry. “Why—why——”</p>

<p>“Hush! Here he is!” warned Grace.</p>

<p>It was not Dr. Klauss, however, but one of his
men with a supply of dry clothing for the boys
and the professor.</p>

<p>“I will take you to the cabins you are to occupy,”
said this man, who spoke without any German
accent. Jerry was glad to note this. It
meant, in case of trouble, that perhaps they could
count on this American to aid them. Jerry was
sorely puzzled.</p>

<p>“You are to come with me,” the man went on,
respectfully. “After you are dressed I will take
your clothing to the engine room to dry. Then
you will be served with a meal, Dr. Klauss says.
Come.”</p>

<p>“Supper, eh?” cried Bob. “That sounds
good, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“I see you haven’t gotten over your old habit,”
laughed Mr. Sheldon. “Well, come back when
you can, boys. We are certainly glad to see you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” echoed Grace, and she looked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Jerry particularly. He understood what she
meant.</p>

<p>“And to think that we are actually traveling
under water!” marveled Ned. “About how deep
are we?” he asked of the man who had brought
the clothing.</p>

<p>“Oh, about three hundred feet, I should judge.
I didn’t notice the gage as I came through the engine
room. But Dr. Klauss will probably let you
see for yourselves soon.”</p>

<p>“Are we still going down?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“A little, yes. About five hundred feet is as
deep as we can go, for, even in this wonderful
boat, which is the best submarine I ever saw or
heard of, the weight of water much below five hundred
feet would crush us like an egg shell. In
fact there are very few boats of this class that go
more than two hundred feet down, and really that
depth isn’t necessary even in war time. But we
members of the crew are not supposed to give out
information. Dr. Klauss would not like it. So
you’ll have to excuse me.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Jerry. The man seemed
a pleasant chap, and spoke like a person of intelligence.
Jerry was glad he was aboard, for somehow,
the tall lad felt an indefinable sense of
danger.</p>

<p>The boys were taken to small adjoining staterooms,
where they were told to change, and put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
their wet garments outside. The clothing that had
been supplied to them was all sorts of odds and
ends, evidently collected from different members of
the crew. But it was dry and warm, and a welcome
relief from their drenched garments, the
wearing of which much longer would have given
them all colds.</p>

<p>“This is some change from out in that storm,
on the back of this submarine, knocking to be let
in; isn’t it, fellows?” called Jerry from his stateroom.</p>

<p>“I should say yes,” agreed Ned. “Poor old
<i>Comet</i>! What do you suppose happened to her?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid she’s broken up,” answered Jerry,
mournfully. “Once the pontoons give way, the
weight of the engines will sink her. Well, we can
build another.”</p>

<p>“Or a submarine,” added Ned.</p>

<p>“First we’ve got to see if we can get off of this
one,” said Jerry in a low voice.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Ned, who had
dressed quickly, and now stood at the door of his
chum’s stateroom.</p>

<p>“You’ll see soon enough,” was the answer.
“There’s something strange going on here, boys.
Grace and Mr. Sheldon could only give a hint of
it. We’ll have to be on the watch. This man
Klauss——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cheese it!” interrupted Ned, effectively if not
elegantly. “He’s coming!”</p>

<p>Jerry halted his remarks just in time, for the inventor
of the submarine came along a second
later.</p>

<p>“Well, boys,” he asked, in a tone he tried to
make cordial, “how are you making out? Will
those clothes answer until your own are dry?”</p>

<p>“Very well indeed, yes; thank you,” replied
Jerry. “We are sorry to have to put you to so
much trouble——”</p>

<p>“It could not be helped,” was the response of
the German. “I could not leave you there to
drown. Now if you will come with me I will tell
you something about my ship—it is my one
hobby!”</p>

<p>“And you will not forget about giving me a
chance to get to the bottom of the sea, and capture
some crabs; will you?” asked Professor Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“I will do what I can for you—as a fellow scientist,”
said Dr. Klauss.</p>

<p>The boys found Grace and her father eagerly
awaiting them, and a hasty midnight meal was
served in the main cabin. Dr. Klauss left the little
party to themselves, saying that he had to go
to see about some of the mechanism.</p>

<p>“Say, I don’t see what we’ve got to complain
of,” remarked Bob, with his mouth half full.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
“Here we are, warm and dry, even if we are
under water, and we’ve got plenty to eat——”</p>

<p>“Which, I suppose, excuses many evils in your
eyes, Bob, my boy,” interrupted his uncle. “Oh,
Dr. Klauss will not starve us—of that Grace and I
have had excellent proof.”</p>

<p>“Well, then we’ll be all right,” spoke Chunky,
with a contented sigh, as he helped himself to some
more cake, for the menu included even that.
“They have a good cook here,” went on the stout
lad.</p>

<p>“We must find time and the chance for a consultation,”
remarked Mr. Sheldon, speaking rapidly,
and in a low voice. “I want to explain certain
things, and plan what to do.”</p>

<p>“Is there any danger?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes—I think so—of a certain kind—though
I do not mean that our lives are actually at stake.
But our liberty certainly is.”</p>

<p>“You mean——” began Ned.</p>

<p>“I mean that this fanatic refuses to set Grace
and me ashore, or to let us go aboard some other
vessel. I want you boys to make that same request,
when the time comes, and see what he says.
Then we will have something to go on. But be
very careful. Oh, it is good to be with friends
again!” and Mr. Sheldon looked affectionately at
the lads.</p>

<p>Dr. Klauss came in before the meal was finished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
All this time the <i>Sonderbaar</i> was plowing along
beneath the surface, but at what depth, or in what
direction the boys could only guess. There were
no indicators in this main cabin.</p>

<p>“Would you lads like to see something of my
submarine?” asked the German.</p>

<p>“Indeed we would!” exclaimed Jerry with an
enthusiasm that was echoed by his chums.</p>

<p>“Then come with me,” invited their strange
host, and he led the way toward the engine room,
as could be told by the hum and throb that came
from it. “Will you accompany us, Mr. Sheldon?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, no. I will stay with my daughter.
It is late, and she ought to retire.”</p>

<p>Indeed it was long past midnight, but in that
depth of water time did not seem to count for
much. There was perpetual darkness at all hours.</p>

<p>But the boys and Professor Snodgrass, though
tired after what they had passed through, were not
too weary to view the interior of this marvelous
boat.</p>

<p>I do not wish to tire my readers with a technical
description of the <i>Sonderbaar</i>, so I will merely
say that she was, like most submarines, of elliptical
shape, tapering to blunt points on either end,
though the stern, where the two propellers were,
was wider than the bow.</p>

<p>The boat was about two hundred feet long and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
about forty feet in diameter, her dimensions being
greatly in excess of most submarines. It was this
that enabled her to be made strong enough to
stand the pressure of five hundred feet of water,
which pressure is enormous on every square inch
of surface.</p>

<p>This large size also gave more room inside for
engines, and quarters for captain and crew. Thus
there was much more comfort than in the usual
submarine.</p>

<p>There were no periscopes, or tubes, elevated
above the deck on the <i>Sonderbaar</i>. Observation,
when running awash, was by means of a lens flush
in the deck, a peculiar arrangement of mirrors and
prisms giving the effect of periscopes without their
disadvantages.</p>

<p>There was also an automatic arrangement of
diaphragms, similar to those in telephone receivers,
so that when the craft was running under
water, and approached some obstacle, its presence
would be made manifest in time to avoid it. Nor
was this all. Dr. Klauss had perfected a powerful
lamp which was located in the bow of his craft,
projecting its beams through the water. This
would also disclose any object that might endanger
a collision. But the diaphragms acted over a
wider area than the lamp, the beams of which were
necessarily dimmed by the density of the water.</p>

<p>As in all submarines, it was necessary to let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
water into ballast tanks in order to make her sink,
and to rise it was only necessary to pump out this
same water, by means of compressed air. But Dr.
Klauss had made many improvements even in this
simple and fundamental principle.</p>

<p>The propulsion of the <i>Sonderbaar</i> was by means
of twin screws at the stern, and each screw had its
own engine—a gasoline one when running on the
surface, and an electrical motor, run by a new
type of storage battery, when submerged. The
propeller shafts passed through the armatures of
the motors, which were mounted directly on the
shafts, revolving with them, and acting as flywheels
when the gasoline engines were being used.
At such times the circuits of the field windings
were open, and no current was generated.</p>

<p>There were also dynamos for the making of
electric illumination and charging the storage battery,
and small motors to work pumps and other
devices. In fact the craft was complete, mechanically.</p>

<p>She was steered by two rudders, one to guide
her to port or starboard—or left and right, as the
new navy regulations specify—and another rudder
to send her to the surface or toward the bottom
of the sea.</p>

<p>All this Dr. Klauss showed the boys, explaining
many things, for he saw they were greatly interested;
but, of course, there were some secrets he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
did not reveal. And one of these was the method
of firing the deadly torpedoes.</p>

<p>The ship could be controlled from the engine
room, or from the pilot house, in the bow, and
here there was a perfect maze of levers, wheels,
switches and other devices. Gages told of the
boat’s speed, of her depth, and gave all the information
it was necessary for the pilot to know.</p>

<p>“And now I think you need rest,” said the inventor,
when the tour of the boat was completed.
“I shall see you in the morning.”</p>

<p>“You have a marvelous boat, Dr. Klauss,” said
Jerry, sincerely. “I congratulate you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, my lad. I am sorry we had to
leave your own air craft at the mercy of the sea,
for, from what Mr. Sheldon told me of her, in
our conversations after I rescued him, I understand
it was a wonder of its own kind. But I had
my own reasons for not lingering longer there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, it couldn’t be helped,” said Jerry,
but he could not refrain from sighing.</p>

<p>“Say, I don’t see what’s the matter with Dr.
Klauss. He seems very decent,” remarked Bob,
when the boys had reached their staterooms.</p>

<p>“Better wait,” remarked Jerry, significantly.
“Mr. Sheldon didn’t make his remark for
nothing.”</p>

<small>A CRAZED CAPTAIN</small></h2>


<p>“Say, wouldn’t it have been a joke if he had
followed us all the way?” chuckled Bob Baker, as
he awoke late in the morning, and called to Jerry.</p>

<p>“Who?” asked the tall lad, yawning, for he
had slept well after the day of excitement, with
its various happenings.</p>

<p>“Noddy Nixon,” went on the stout lad. “You
know he started to follow us—he and Bill Berry.
Wouldn’t they have had the surprise of their lives
if they’d seen us get aboard this submarine.”</p>

<p>“They sure would,” agreed Ned. “And I
reckon they’d be glad because our <i>Comet</i> went
to smash. Poor old ship! Will we ever have
another?”</p>

<p>“I think we’ll go in for submarines,” announced
Jerry. “This boat is a marvel! If we could only
get one like this—or half the size, we could have
no end of adventures!”</p>

<p>“And think of the service you could render science,”
broke in Professor Snodgrass. “There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
are wonders of the sea never even dreamed of,
and we could bring them to light. Oh, I must see
when Dr. Klauss can let me get after those hermit
crabs.”</p>

<p>“Are we still moving?” asked Bob, beginning
to dress.</p>

<p>“We seem to be,” said Jerry, as he felt a tremor
throughout the craft that showed her engines to
be working. “No telling where we are, though.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s get up, and see what Mr. Sheldon
has to say, boys,” advised Jerry.</p>

<p>They were about to don the borrowed garments
when a member of the crew—the same one who
had taken away their own clothes to dry—came
back with them. The boys were glad to get into
their own things again.</p>

<p>“How large a crew is there aboard?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“There are five of us, but really three men can
work the whole ship,” replied the sailor. “There
are two old German scientists aboard, who will
help if they are needed, but I and my two mates
generally work together. My name is Ted Rowland,
and my mates’ names are Bill Burke and
Tom Flynn. We’re machinists, and we’re all
wishing we hadn’t signed for this voyage. But
we’re in for it now. You see we’re all Irish,” he
explained with a twinkle in his blue eyes, “and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Dutch and the Irish never mix any too well. Still
I shouldn’t talk so. Dr. Klauss pays us well.”</p>

<p>“What about his German friends?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, we don’t see much of them. They keep
to their own quarters, all the time figuring something
on paper, drawing plans, and the like. Dr.
Klauss spends a lot of time with them, too.
They’re planning something, but we’re not supposed
to know what it is.”</p>

<p>“How did you come to get in with the doctor?”
asked Jerry, who thought it would be a good plan
to obtain all the information he could.</p>

<p>“Oh, it was just by chance. I and my mates
had been on one of Uncle Sam’s submarines, and
a short time ago we saw an advertisement to take
a private berth at a good figure, so we answered
it. In that way we met Dr. Klauss and his two foreign
friends.</p>

<p>“It seems he built this vessel in Germany, and
brought it over here with a foreign crew. But
there was a quarrel and he fired them. He had to
have help, so he got us.”</p>

<p>“Who steers her?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Dr. Klauss, mostly, though I’ve taken a hand
at it. I understand navigation, though you have
to go pretty much by dead reckoning when you’re
under water. Then, too, there’s an automatic
steering apparatus that will work for a limited
time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“Has Dr. Klauss any special object in cruising
about?” Jerry wanted to know.</p>

<p>“If he has he hasn’t told me and my mates,”
was the man’s answer. “He’s just been scooting
about here, there—anywhere. I recall the time
we first sighted you—he got away from that vicinity
in a hurry. Seemed afraid, like.”</p>

<p>“I wonder why?” mused Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be getting back to quarters,” said
Ted Rowland. “I have to look after the oiling.
See you again,” and he took away with him the
borrowed garments.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the program?” asked Ned, when
he and his chums had had breakfast. They ate
alone save for Professor Snodgrass, Mr. Sheldon
and his daughter having eaten earlier.</p>

<p>“I fancy we had better first have a talk with
your uncle, Bob,” replied the tall lad. “He may
be able to advise us. It is all very nice to be
aboard here, scooting along under the sea, but we
ought to be home. Our folks will surely be worried
about us, especially if any part of our wrecked
motorship is picked up by some vessel. Word will
go back to Cresville that we are lost.”</p>

<p>“And my uncle, too,” added Bob. “Probably
father and mother have already given him up for
lost.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ve got to make a bid to get back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
land,” decided Ned. “Let’s look up Mr. Sheldon.”</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass was so busy over some of
his scientific notes that he paid little attention to
the boys, and they felt they could leave him for
the time being.</p>

<p>They found Bob’s uncle and cousin in the main
cabin. Dr. Klauss, Mr. Sheldon said, had gone
to the engine room, as there was some difficulty
with one of the motors.</p>

<p>“And where are we?” asked Jerry anxiously.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re running along, about three hundred
feet under the surface,” answered Mr. Sheldon.
“I was just in the pilot house, and noted
the depth gage. As for our exact location, I can’t
say. Somewhere beneath the Atlantic ocean.”</p>

<p>“That’s a big place,” remarked Bob. “And
have we been under water all night?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“The air is very fresh,” observed Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, we carry enough for several days,” remarked
Mr. Sheldon. “The <i>Sonderbaar</i> could
be submerged nearly a week at a pinch, so Dr.
Klauss says.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t want to stay down here that long,”
came from Jerry. “What are we going to do,
Mr. Sheldon? We have come to you for advice.
We feel that we ought to go back home.”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly how I feel about it, my boy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
But the difficulty is that Dr. Klauss won’t put us
ashore.”</p>

<p>“He won’t?”</p>

<p>“No. He refused in my case; decently enough,
but firmly. Now my plan is to have you boys ask
him. If he acts in the same way he must have
some reason for it. If he acts and talks differently
it may indicate what I have begun to suspect.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” inquired Bob.</p>

<p>“Wait until you make your request,” was the
reply. “Then you can judge for yourselves. He
is a very strange man. Ask him the first chance
you get.”</p>

<p>The opportunity came sooner than the boys expected.
Shortly after their talk with Mr. Sheldon,
Dr. Klauss came into the main cabin.</p>

<p>“Doctor,” began Jerry, “can you spare us a
few moments?”</p>

<p>“What for?” and the words came with a snap.</p>

<p>“We wish to find out when you are going to
set us ashore, or put us on some other vessel. You
have been very kind, but we must not tax your
hospitality further. We want to get back to
America.”</p>

<p>“And I say you shall not go!” fairly shouted
the captain. “I am not going back to the United
States until I come again with a fleet that will
destroy all their ships!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“Doctor!” cried Mr. Sheldon, leaping to his
feet. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Just what I say! I am going back to my own
country, and build more submarines. I have
proved what this one will do. With her, and
more like her, I can destroy the whole United
States navy. And I’m going to do it! I’m going
to do it!</p>

<p>“I hate you! I hate all Americans. They shot
my brother in the Spanish-American War, and I
am going to revenge him. They called him a spy.
He was not! I say he was not!</p>

<p>“America! You shall never see it again. I
did not ask you to come aboard my vessel, but,
since you are here, you must take the consequences.
I shall not turn you free to have you reveal my
secrets—the secrets I have guarded for years. I
shall keep you with me forever. You shall never
see home again!</p>

<p>“America! Bah! How I hate her!” and he
stamped his feet with rage. “I shall wipe her
from the face of the earth. No, I will not put you
ashore! I shall not put you aboard some other
vessel, to let her crew pry into my secrets! I tell
you I will not! You are here—here you shall
stay. Don’t ask me again!</p>

<p>“When my brother was shot—shot unjustly as
a spy—I vowed to be revenged. Now my chance
has come. After many years I have perfected my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
submarine. In it I can carry enough torpedoes to
destroy a whole flotilla of United States warships,
and some day I will do it.</p>

<p>“I hate Americans! I have three in my crew,
but they shall never see their own land again. Nor
will you! Don’t ask me again.”</p>

<p>“But, Dr. Klauss,” said Mr. Sheldon, endeavoring
to speak calmly, “please consider——”</p>

<p>“No! I will consider nothing! Here you are—and
here you will remain—aboard my submarine.
I did not ask you to come—I did not want
you. I am a monster, perhaps—a monster when
I think of my wrongs; but I could not leave you
to drown. You owe me a debt for saving your
lives.</p>

<p>“Very well! You will pay that debt by never
seeing your own country again. I have you—I
shall keep you!” and his voice rose to a scream
as, clapping his hands together, he rushed from
the cabin.</p>

<small>PLOTTING</small></h2>


<p>With fear in their hearts the refugees stared
at one another. Grace Sheldon shrank close to
her father, who silently patted her shoulder.</p>

<p>“There, there, Grace,” he said, soothingly, “I
dare say we shall find a way out of this. Don’t
worry.”</p>

<p>“But, Papa, I can’t help it,” she replied in tremulous
tones. “He—I’m afraid—yes, I’m sure
he’s insane—Dr. Klauss is certainly insane.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sheldon looked at Jerry and his chums.</p>

<p>“What is your opinion, boys?” he asked. “You
heard what he said; what do you think?”</p>

<p>“I think as Grace does,” declared Bob. “We
are in a submarine with a madman!”</p>

<p>Jerry nodded his head slowly.</p>

<p>“That is my view,” he stated, in a low voice.
“Either his imaginary wrongs, or his labors over
this craft have turned his brain. He is certainly
insane.” Ned indicated his acquiescence.</p>

<p>“Then, since we are agreed on that—and I may
say I came to this conclusion some time ago,” went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
on Mr. Sheldon, “the next question is—what can
we do?”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to do something,” declared Jerry,
firmly. “It is risking our lives to stay here.”</p>

<p>“But how can we get away?” asked Ned. “If
we were on an ordinary ship we would have some
chance. We could drop overboard, if worse came
to worst, and swim. Or we might lower a boat
some dark night, and get away in that.</p>

<p>“But here we are, five hundred feet, more or
less, under water. We don’t even know how to
get out of this boat, save by the hatchway, and to
open that under water would mean the death of
all of us.”</p>

<p>“Of course!” exclaimed Jerry. “That is not
to be thought of. But there must be some other
way of getting out of this boat while under water,
if what Dr. Klauss told Professor Snodgrass is
true. You remember he spoke of going out in
diving suits on the bottom of the sea. There must
be some arrangement of double doors, and a water
chamber in the side of the boat.”</p>

<p>“But, even if we did get out, what good would
that do?” asked Ned. “We couldn’t swim home,
and we couldn’t all live in diving suits. There must
be some other way.”</p>

<p>“There is but one way that I can see,” spoke
Mr. Sheldon.</p>

<p>“And that is——” began Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“To compel this madman, by some means, to
put us ashore or on some vessel.”</p>

<p>“But how can we?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s what we’ve got to plan,” said Jerry,
who seemed to fall in with Mr. Sheldon’s plan.
“That’s what we’ve got to talk over.”</p>

<p>“And if he refuses again, as he most likely
will?”</p>

<p>Jerry looked around the cabin before answering.
Then, in a low voice he said:</p>

<p>“There’s but one course left—mutiny!”</p>

<p>“Mutiny!” gasped Grace.</p>

<p>“I mean that we shall have to try to influence
the crew against their captain. I know that is considered
contrary to marine law, but in dealing with
a maniac there is no law. We have to save our
lives, and that is the first law of nature.”</p>

<p>“But will the crew help us?” queried Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s what we’ve got to find out,” returned
Jerry. “I fancy they haven’t any love for their
captain, and they can hardly refuse to help us—especially
when we tell them what he said. Why,
their own case is as bad as ours.”</p>

<p>“But there are two other Germans aboard,”
spoke Bob. “They would doubtless side with Dr.
Klauss.”</p>

<p>“That would only make three,” remarked
Jerry, “and if we can get the crew to side with
us we’d have nine on our side. That ought to answer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Even if the crew won’t help us, we three
fellows, and Mr. Sheldon and the professor, ought
to be able to hold our own against the six. Those
two Germans are likely to be old men.”</p>

<p>“But Rowland and his mates are probably
husky chaps,” objected Bob.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe Ted Rowland will be against
us when he hears what has happened,” said Mr.
Sheldon. “At worst we can but try, and really we
must do something.</p>

<p>“When Dr. Klauss first rescued Grace and me,”
he went on, “I suspected that all was not right
with him. He had a most peculiar air. But it was
not until I spoke of wanting to get to my friends
that opposition developed. Even then it was not
very strong. Dr. Klauss merely made various
excuses, and I thought perhaps he wanted to complete
some experimental tests before turning back
to shore.</p>

<p>“But as a day or so passed his actions became
more peculiar. Then he flatly refused to let Grace
and me go. I then feared I had to do with a madman,
though I did not disclose my apprehension.
I did not know what to do.</p>

<p>“When you boys so unexpectedly and providentially
arrived I took heart. It was a trick of fate.
We had been traveling all that day, and at night
went to the surface for air. We could hear the
storm raging. Suddenly something struck the submarine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and Dr. Klauss grew much excited. He
seemed to think he was being attacked. Then he
investigated, turned on the light and—well, you
know the rest, for you boys came in.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we came in,” spoke Bob, with grim humor,
“and now the puzzle is how to get out again.
It’s like a trap.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll get out somehow,” declared Jerry,
with more confidence than he felt.</p>

<p>“One thing we might do,” said Mr. Sheldon.
“And that is to wait one more day. Then we can
renew our request.”</p>

<p>“Why wait?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Because,” answered his uncle, “the mind of
an insane person changes. At one time he may
refuse to do something, and later he will grant your
request. Dr. Klauss is no doubt crazy on only one
subject. That is his fancied grievance against our
country. That has made him insane. We will
make another request, to-morrow, to be set ashore,
and if he refuses—why, we will see what we can
do with the crew. Fortunately we have our freedom
on board, and that means a lot. If he locked
us up we would have hard work to perfect our
plot.”</p>

<p>“And now, Uncle Nelson,” said Bob, “while
we are having this conference, won’t you tell me
what it is that you were bringing from Germany
that was so valuable?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is valuable yet, Bob,” was the reply. “I
still have it, for I saved it from the shipwreck.
But, if it’s all the same to you, I had rather not
mention it here. We can’t tell who may be listening,
and if Dr. Klauss knew I had this he might
take such precautions to prevent me from ever getting
away that it would spoil all our plans.”</p>

<p>“Why, is it his?”</p>

<p>“Well, he claims it, but it is not his. Some
time later I will tell you,” and with this Bob and
his chums had to be content.</p>

<p>As there was nothing that could be done for the
present the little party sat about the cabin, talking.
Mr. Sheldon had been shown by Dr. Klauss how
to open the shutters of the side windows, and how
to illuminate the water so that the fishes might be
observed.</p>

<p>“It will give us something to do—something
to take our minds off our troubles—to watch the
denizens of the deep,” he said as he opened the
slides.</p>

<p>The <i>Sonderbaar</i> was plowing along far below
the surface, but in what direction, or in what locality,
the boys could not tell. Nor could they
say whither they were eventually going, save perhaps
back toward Germany.</p>

<p>But the wonderful sight that greeted their eyes—the
illuminated waters swarming with ocean life—so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
interested them that, for the time, they forgot
their troubles.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I could but go out there, and get some
specimens!” sighed Professor Snodgrass. “I
must make notes of what I see, at least,” and he
busied himself with pencil and paper.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t want to go out with that fellow
around,” observed Bob, with a shudder, as an immense
tiger shark swam into view. “He could
bite a man in twain at one clip.”</p>

<p>“And see that octopus!” cried Ned, pointing.</p>

<p>For some time the boys, Grace and Mr. Sheldon
watched the marvelous sight. Then Jerry suggested:</p>

<p>“I wonder if we would be stopped if we went to
the pilot house or engine room? I should like to
see how the ship is navigated.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it might come in useful if we carry
out our mutiny,” added Ned.</p>

<p>“Hush!” spoke Jerry quickly. “Not so loud.
Dr. Klauss may come upon us at any time.”</p>

<p>Ned looked around apprehensively, but the fanatical
captain had not entered the darkened cabin.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to make a try, anyhow,” went
on Jerry. “He can’t do more than order me out.
Besides, I may get a chance to sound the crew.”</p>

<p>“I think it would be a good idea,” agreed Mr.
Sheldon. “We have no time to lose. While we
are fairly comfortable here, think of the anxiety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of our friends and relatives—of the parents of you
boys. We simply <em>must</em> get away from this madman!”</p>

<p>So far as the boys could tell they had the run
of the ship. No restrictions had been placed on
them, and they felt free to go where they liked.
Especially were they anxious to observe how the
strange craft was operated. It was knowledge
that might be of vital necessity soon.</p>

<p>If their next request to be set free was met with
a refusal, then it would be time to put their plot
into execution.</p>

<p>Jerry, Ned and Bob had risen to go to the engine
room, when Grace, who was standing near
one of the glass windows in the side of the cabin
gave a startled cry:</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked her father.</p>

<p>“Look!” she gasped. “A whale—a great
whale, and he seems about to hit us! Oh, tell Dr.
Klauss—quick!”</p>

<p>She pointed to the window where could be
seen, keeping pace with the submarine, a monster
whale that was fairly rubbing against the side of
the boat.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>IN DIVING DRESS</small></h2>


<p>The presence of the whale, which was almost
half the size of the <i>Sonderbaar</i>, so close to the
submarine, and the menacing attitude of the great
mammal, which easily kept pace with the under-water
ship, were enough to alarm our friends, and
cause them to fear for the safety of the boat.</p>

<p>“Jove! He is a big one!” gasped Jerry.</p>

<p>“And he looks wicked, too,” added Ned.</p>

<p>“Shall I call Dr. Klauss?” inquired Bob, glancing
at Mr. Sheldon, to whom Grace was clinging
in fright.</p>

<p>“I think you had better,” was the reply. “There
may be no danger, but it is best to be on the safe
side. Dr. Klauss may be insane on one subject, but
he probably will know what to do to get rid of this
whale.”</p>

<p>The German commander had not been in the
main cabin for some time, nor had any of the crew
been seen. As for the doctor’s two countrymen
it yet remained for our friends to have a glimpse
of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll get him!” cried Bob, hastening toward the
pilot house, along a well-lighted passage way. The
whole interior of the submarine was illuminated by
incandescents, which were always kept aglow. Naturally
this was necessary for, speeding along under
water as she had been ever since Jerry and his
chums came aboard, the craft was in utter darkness.</p>

<p>As he sped to summon the commander Bob saw
the whale draw off a little to one side, though still
keeping pace with the submarine.</p>

<p>“He’s getting ready to charge!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>Bob lost no time. He found Dr. Klauss in the
pilot house, peering ahead into the dimly lighted
path of radiance along which his craft was speeding.
The commander had before him a bewildering
array of controls, while near his ears were the
diaphragms that, by their buzzing sound, would
give telephonic warning of any obstruction.</p>

<p>“Dr. Klauss! Dr. Klauss!” gasped Bob.
“There’s a big whale alongside the main cabin!
He acts as though he was going to ram us. Can
he do any damage? Hadn’t you better do something?”</p>

<p>“Ach! So!” exclaimed the German in his deep,
guttural voice. He glanced at Bob with rather a
friendly look. In fact Dr. Klauss seemed to have
forgotten his recent insane outburst.</p>

<p>“A whale; eh? Well, it is not the first time I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
have been rammed by one, but it is not pleasant,
and deranges the machinery. I think we must
stop this one.”</p>

<p>Setting the automatic steering gear, which, in a
way, was like the one that had been on the <i>Comet</i>,
Dr. Klauss hastened after Bob.</p>

<p>“If the whale is still there,” said the German as
they went along the passage, “you shall see a curious
sight. I have no desire to take animal life
except in the interest of science, but I cannot have
my craft damaged.”</p>

<p>“How can you kill him? By ramming—going
at him full speed?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“No, I shall use the electric gun that I have
rigged up for this very purpose. Watch and you
shall see.”</p>

<p>They entered the cabin, outside the window of
which the whale still held his place, swimming
along with the submarine. Once again, as they
watched, they saw the great animal draw back as
though to come full tilt, head on against the side
of the vessel.</p>

<p>“And if he hits that glass it will be all up with
us!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, the glass is strong, but still I do not wish
to have him hit it,” remarked Dr. Klauss. “Now,
if you will watch you will see something.”</p>

<p>He went to a small cabinet set in the wall of the
cabin, and when it was opened there was disclosed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
a dial, not unlike that of a clock, with a movable
pointer in the centre. Around the edge of the dial
were letters and figures.</p>

<p>“This is my under-water electric gun,” said Dr.
Klauss. “By moving this pointer about the dial
I can point the muzzle of the gun in any direction.
There are three guns, one on either side, and one
in the bow. I will use the one on the side nearest
the whale. You cannot see the gun, but you will
see what it does.”</p>

<p>The boys, Professor Snodgrass, who had come
into the main cabin, and Grace and her father
looked on with interested and anxious eyes. The
submarine was still shooting along under water,
and the whale was keeping pace, every now and
then drawing back as if for an attack.</p>

<p>“Watch!” suddenly cried Dr. Klauss. He
quickly glanced out at the whale, as if to judge of
his aim, and then swung the pointer of the dial
about. There was a slight click, and the whale
seemed to disappear in a smother of red foam.
The submarine rushed on, but the great animal
was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>“Why—why!” gasped Bob. “It—it’s gone!”</p>

<p>“I thought it would,” remarked the doctor,
calmly. “I fired an electric bomb into the whale,
and it exploded inside, killing the brute instantly.
What you saw was really a slight lightning stroke
hitting the creature.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jove!” murmured Jerry. “That’s some gun,
all right!”</p>

<p>“I am glad you like it,” said Dr. Klauss, and
his tone was so different from that he had used
before that a gleam of hope came to Mr. Sheldon
and the others. Possibly the commander would
let his prisoners go without the necessity of taking
extreme measures.</p>

<p>“And that is the end of the whale,” remarked
Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I am glad you called me,” said Dr.
Klauss. “He might have damaged us.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sheldon resolved to pursue the seeming
advantage, and asked:</p>

<p>“How much longer is this voyage going to last,
Dr. Klauss?”</p>

<p>“That I cannot say,” was the somewhat stiff
answer. “I am not in a position to decide yet.
But I will say one thing, that, if you like, you will
witness some interesting events. I am soon going
to the bottom of the sea, and as I wish to make
some close observations I am going out of the boat
in a diving suit. You may come with me, if you
like,” he said to Professor Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“May I?” cried the little scientist eagerly.
“Then I certainly shall. I must get those specimens
of hermit crabs. Oh! what an opportunity
has come to me. I would not have missed it for
a fortune!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>The three chums looked at one another and at
Mr. Sheldon. The same thought was in the minds
of all. If the German left the ship might they not
easily gain control of her? Then their problem
would be solved. But if Professor Snodgrass
went out also that would make it more difficult.</p>

<p>Mr. Sheldon made a sign to Jerry that he would
speak to Professor Snodgrass, and Jerry nodded
comprehendingly.</p>

<p>Dr. Klauss did not seem to have seen this byplay.
He closed the little cabinet containing the
gun pointer, and remarked:</p>

<p>“If you will come with me now, I will show you
how we leave the ship and walk on the bottom of
the sea. We are about at the place.”</p>

<p>They went with him to the engine room, where
the three Americans were busy over the machinery.
On the way the party, including Grace, who kept
close to her father, passed a small room in which
could be seen two elderly Germans, busy over
books and papers. Dr. Klauss said something to
them in a foreign tongue—not German, as the
boys could tell, for they had studied that language
at school.</p>

<p>The two men, who seemed like learned professors,
got up and followed the party to the engine
room.</p>

<p>“I always have them near at hand when I leave
the ship to go out in my diving dress,” explained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the commander. “There might be an—accident,
you know,” and Jerry thought the fanatic regarded
his guests in a peculiar manner.</p>

<p>Mr. Sheldon found a chance to hurriedly whisper
to Professor Snodgrass that it might not be
wise for him to go out on the bottom of the sea,
and the scientist, who quickly grasped the reason,
agreed not to take advantage of the offer of Dr.
Klauss at this time.</p>

<p>“As you may have realized,” said the inventor
to his guests, “a very strong diving dress is needed
in working at great depths, in order to sustain the
enormous pressure of water. The greatest depth
to which an ordinary diver can descend is two hundred
feet—seldom this. But I am going to reach
the bottom of the sea at a point where it is about
six hundred feet deep, and so the pressure will increase
in proportion. It will be perfectly safe in
my diving suit, though, and if any of you would
like to try it——”</p>

<p>He paused suggestively.</p>

<p>“I think we will wait,” said Mr. Sheldon.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I have also changed my mind,” added
Professor Snodgrass. “There are no hermit
crabs in these waters, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“No,” assented Dr. Klauss, with a smile.
“Well, some other time I hope to have the pleasure
of taking you to the bottom of the sea with
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>The commander seemed so pleasant and affable
that it was hard to realize his mood of a short
time before.</p>

<p>“We could have a dandy time here, if he was
only all right,” thought Jerry. “If we could go
when we pleased, and could send word to our
folks, I’d like a submarine voyage.”</p>

<p>But, under the circumstances, the very lives of
Jerry and his chums might be in danger.</p>

<p>“Get ready!” called the inventor to his three
engineers. “Sink the boat!”</p>

<p>There was a hissing as more water was pumped
into the ballast tanks, and the forward motion of
the craft ceased, to give place to a downward one.
For a moment the visitors felt a queer sensation
as when an elevator drops suddenly, but they soon
grew used to this. In a few minutes the boat came
to a rest with a slight shock.</p>

<p>“We are now on the bottom of the sea,” explained
Dr. Klauss. “I shall now don my diving
suit, and go out of the boat. Probably you have
anticipated how this is done.</p>

<p>“I enter a small opening in the side of my ship—a
sort of niche that opens inside. The inner
door is then hermetically sealed. I am in a sort
of closet. By means of valves, water is then admitted
until it equals the pressure outside. The
outer door is then opened, and I can step upon the
bottom of the sea. I carry about with me, on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
back, a tank of compressed air, so I have no need
of the air hose ordinarily used by divers.”</p>

<p>“Say! That’s great!” cried Jerry, almost
wishing he could try on one of the suits.</p>

<p>“All ready now!” called the doctor, and one
of the machinists began taking out a diving dress
from a compartment. It was a heavy affair, with
lead-soled shoes, and it took two men to help the
doctor into it. In appearance it was not unlike the
usual diving dress, save that the helmet was more
complicated, as it had to be because of its detachment
from the usual air hose.</p>

<p>The doctor was soon encased in his modern suit
of water-armor, and with the screwing shut of his
helmet he could no longer communicate with his
men except by signs. But they understood him.</p>

<p>The boys were fascinated by the strangeness of
the proceeding, and hardly stopped to consider
their position. Nor did they realize that they
were resting upon the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>Dr. Klauss moved slowly toward a steel-studded
door in the side of the engine room. It opened,
disclosing a closet-like compartment. Beyond the
outer door of this was the sea, pressing with enormous
force.</p>

<p>Dr. Klauss made a sign—he seemed to be bidding
farewell to those in the submarine. Then he
stepped into the compartment, the door was shut
and sealed. Jerry and his chums drew long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
breaths. They had not realized the nervous strain
they were under.</p>

<p>An instant later there was a hissing sound, as
the water rushed in through the valves. It lasted
only a short time. Then came a slight click.</p>

<p>“He is out!” exclaimed Ted Rowland.</p>

<p>Dr. Klauss was walking around on the bottom
of the ocean!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<small>THE DECISION</small></h2>


<p>“Can we see him?”</p>

<p>“Where will he go?”</p>

<p>“What is he going to do?”</p>

<p>Jerry, Ned and Bob thus eagerly questioned the
three machinists, and Ted Rowland answered:</p>

<p>“If you go into the forward cabin you can look
out through the side windows and watch him.
Don’t turn on the light, or you can’t see as well.
Dr. Klauss carries a submarine lamp with him,
and you can make him out by that.”</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Jerry, eagerly, and he and
his chums, followed by Grace, Mr. Sheldon and
Professor Snodgrass, went into the main cabin.
The two stolid Germans remained in the motor
room, seemingly on guard.</p>

<p>“Why did you not want me to go out there in
a diving suit?” asked the scientist of Mr. Sheldon,
when they were away from the doctor’s friends
and his crew.</p>

<p>“There were two reasons,” was the answer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
“In the first place I feared some harm might befall
you. You are not used to going into deep
water, and he is. Then, too, he might suddenly
go mad out there alone with you, and do you some
injury. We could not save you.</p>

<p>“Another reason was that I thought if we all
stayed together there might be some chance of getting
away—of making our escape. But the only
way, I suppose, would be to go off and leave Dr.
Klauss to his fate. That would be too horrible.
We could not do it except, perhaps, as a last resort.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Professor Snodgrass, who seemed
to take more of an interest in the affairs of his
friends, now that he could not be actively engaged
in getting specimens. “We might keep him a prisoner
in the diving chamber until we took the boat
to shore, and escaped,” he added.</p>

<p>“Well, that might be a good plan,” admitted
Mr. Sheldon, “but I dislike to try it. I think we
ought to give him one more chance to set us free.
If he does not, then we will act. What do you
say, boys?”</p>

<p>“I agree to that,” spoke Jerry. “Besides, we
don’t know where we are now. We ought to make
an observation from the surface of the sea, and I
think the boat will soon go up. Our air must need
replenishing.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll wait,” decided Mr. Sheldon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
“Now for a look at the doctor on the bottom of
the sea.”</p>

<p>“Say,” spoke Bob in a low voice to Ned, “suppose
we do get control of the submarine. Do you
think we can run her?”</p>

<p>“I think so—if the crew will help us, and those
two old Germans don’t interfere,” was the reply.
“We’ll have to sound the crew soon.”</p>

<p>“There he is!” suddenly exclaimed Grace, as
she peered out of the darkened windows in the
side of the cabin. “See him walking along!”</p>

<p>They all beheld the figure of the doctor, in his
strange suit, on the sandy bottom of the sea, carrying
his electric lamp with him. He turned and
flashed it toward the now motionless submarine,
and waved his rubber-encased hand, as if in greeting
of those watching him.</p>

<p>“Say, that’s great!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Look at the fishes around him!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes, and there’s a big shark coming behind
him!” suddenly gasped Jerry. “Say, if that monster
ever attacks him——”</p>

<p>He did not finish.</p>

<p>Walking along on the sand, which was strewn
with shells and stones, while about him waved sinuous
seaweed, Dr. Klauss did not seem aware of
the near presence of the monster fish. But an instant
later something must have warned him, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
he turned, and those watching saw the flash of a
knife in his hand—a long, keen blade.</p>

<p>“That’s better!” whispered Jerry, tensely.</p>

<p>But there was no need for Dr. Klauss to defend
himself. The shark seemed afraid, now that it
had come close to the human fish, and with a sweep
of its big tail it turned and was lost in the gloom
of the sea. Then the German moved on. Other
fishes nosed him, or swam at his side, apparently
curious about the lamp, but none offered to attack
him.</p>

<p>The doctor seemed to be looking about, as
though studying the configuration of the sea bottom.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose can be his object?”
asked Grace.</p>

<p>“He is looking for rare specimens,” declared
Professor Snodgrass. “Oh, that I were with
him! If I could not get a hermit crab, perhaps
I could find something else of value.”</p>

<p>“He’s looking for treasure,” was Bob’s opinion.</p>

<p>“More likely a place where he can safely sink
some of Uncle Sam’s ships!” exclaimed Jerry.
“If ever we get out of this we’ll have to inform
the war authorities, to put them on their guard.”</p>

<p>“That is right,” assented Mr. Sheldon. “I
hardly believe though, that Dr. Klauss is looking
for a marine graveyard. I think he has some
scientific object in view.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Just what the German’s object was, those watching
him could not determine. He soon disappeared
around the bow of the boat, and became
lost to sight. Jerry, who had learned how to do
it, then turned on the lights to illuminate the space
around the boat, and for some time they watched
the fishes, and other forms of life, at the bottom
of the sea.</p>

<p>They talked over their precarious situation, and
agreed that if another appeal to Dr. Klauss should
not be heeded they would see if the crew would not
join them in a mutiny—a justifiable mutiny.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to secure this madman,” said Mr.
Sheldon, “and do the best we can to navigate the
boat ourselves. I only wish I knew where we
are.”</p>

<p>“I think we will soon learn,” spoke Jerry. “We
can’t stay under water forever.”</p>

<p>Dr. Klauss came back into the submarine in
about an hour, the process being reversed to give
him entrance. He said nothing about his trip, nor
whether he had accomplished his purpose, but remarked:</p>

<p>“The next time, Professor Snodgrass, I hope
you will come with me. And some of you boys—I
have several diving suits and, you have seen,
they are perfectly safe.”</p>

<p>“I think I may come—next time,” agreed the
little scientist. “Did you see any hermit crabs?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, but I can take you to a place where they
are plentiful.”</p>

<p>The remainder of the day passed uneventfully.
Mr. Sheldon did not think it wise to renew the request
to be set free.</p>

<p>“We will try him to-morrow,” he said.</p>

<p>The <i>Sonderbaar</i> was again put in motion, speeding
along at a depth of about three hundred feet,
as the boys could tell from the gage. They had
practically the run of the craft, and their presence
was seemingly not noticed by the two old Germans.
Nor did Dr. Klauss introduce his foreign friends
to his prisoner-guests. He simply did not mention
them.</p>

<p>“When are we going up to get some fresh air?”
asked Jerry of Dr. Klauss the next morning, meeting
the inventor near the pilot house.</p>

<p>“Very soon after breakfast,” was the answer.
“My tanks need refilling.”</p>

<p>Jerry hastened to find Mr. Sheldon to tell him
what was to happen, and the refugees ate rather
an excited meal. The cooking on board was done
by one of the three machinists—usually Bill Burke—and
Bob bore testimony that the food was most
excellent, in which, indeed, they all agreed.</p>

<p>Shortly after the meal Dr. Klauss came into the
main cabin to announce:</p>

<p>“We are going up, now, and those who wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
may go on deck. But be careful, for we are in the
middle of the Atlantic and if you fall overboard I
may not be able to rescue you.”</p>

<p>Jerry wondered if there was any significance in
the grim words, or in the smile that accompanied
them. But Dr. Klauss turned away.</p>

<p>There was a new motion to the <i>Sonderbaar</i>.
She seemed to tilt her bow toward the surface, and
soon she shot from the water, and lay inert on the
bosom of the sea. There was a clank of metal
and the German called:</p>

<p>“The hatch is open—those who wish may go
up.”</p>

<p>“Me for some fresh air!” cried Jerry, and the
others followed, one at a time, all glad to be in the
open, and under the blue sky once more.</p>

<p>They looked about in wonder. The submarine,
her deck only slightly above the surface, was in
the midst of the boundless ocean. There was not
another craft in sight, and no land visible. They
were indeed in the middle of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s good to get your nose outside; even
if we are held by the enemy,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I think we must soon put our plan to
the test,” spoke Mr. Sheldon. “I will again make
a request of Dr. Klauss.”</p>

<p>Bob’s uncle was about to go down the hatchway
to seek the German, but, at that moment, Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Klauss came up. He seemed to have forgotten all
about his burst of passion, but when Mr. Sheldon,
a moment later, made his request that he and his
friends and daughter be set ashore, the doctor’s
face flamed red, and in an excited manner he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Now, that will do! No more of that! I told
you that you would never see your country again—and
you will not! I shall keep my word. I
shall return and destroy all the Yankee ships, but
you will not. I will maroon you on a desert island
if I have to! I will not have my plans betrayed!”</p>

<p>“But, Dr. Klauss!” began Jerry. “If we——”</p>

<p>“Silence! Not another word!” was the sharp
retort. “I shall never let you go. I hate you
Americans! Bah! Now go below!” and he
pointed to the open hatch.</p>

<p>Jerry hesitated a moment. He was debating
in his mind whether it would not be well to attack
the madman then and there and settle matters. But
the small open deck was no place for a struggle.
Then, too, there was Grace to consider. Mr. Sheldon
made Jerry a single sign to obey, and the tall
youth started down the narrow hatch. The others
followed.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Ned, when they were by
themselves in the main cabin, “what’s to be
done?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>“Only one thing can now be done,” returned
Mr. Sheldon, solemnly. “We must try to get the
crew on our side, and seize this madman. Then
we will take possession of the boat and sail for
home!”</p>

<p>And in this decision they all agreed.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>THE ALLIES</small></h2>


<p>“Now,” said Mr. Sheldon, a little later, when
they had gone more into detail as to what they
would do, “now, the question is, how shall we approach
the crew—and when?”</p>

<p>“I think we had better take the first chance that
offers itself,” spoke Jerry. “We haven’t any time
to spare. Dr. Klauss is as crazy as ever—that’s
sure, and there’s no telling what he may do.”</p>

<p>“He said something about landing us on a desert
island,” remarked Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, if he’d do that it might not be so bad,”
came from Ned. “We might escape from there.
But the trouble is there’s no certainty that he’d do
that. I think the best plan is to get possession of
the submarine.”</p>

<p>“Providing the crew will help us,” added Mr.
Sheldon. “If they will not we shall have to adopt
another plan.”</p>

<p>There was a sudden motion to the submarine,
and the little daylight that had filtered in through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the top of the side windows of the main deck was
dispelled.</p>

<p>“We are going down!” exclaimed Grace. “Oh
dear! We are going under water again! Oh,
Father, I can’t stand it!” and she sobbed on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“There, there, Grace, my girl,” he comforted
her. “We are doing the best we can. Possibly
in another day we will be our own masters.”</p>

<p>Jerry and his chums were indignant at Dr.
Klauss for causing Grace so much anguish, but
they realized that nothing could be gained by being
rash. They must carefully work out their plans.</p>

<p>The <i>Sonderbaar</i> sank lower and lower in the
water. Soon she was completely submerged and
again, tightly closed, she surged ahead through
the dark sea. Whither were they going? What
had fate in store for the refugees? None could
answer.</p>

<p>The remainder of that day Dr. Klauss was not
seen. The meals were served without him, nor
did his two foreign friends come to the table.
Jerry, his chums, Mr. Sheldon and Grace had the
dining cabin to themselves. Grace, in a measure,
had recovered her composure, and begged the boys
not to think her a nuisance for having given way
to her feelings.</p>

<p>“That’s all right!” exclaimed Bob, stoutly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
“We’ll soon have the upper hand of this crazy—submarinist.”</p>

<p>“That’s a new word,” laughed Grace, and they
all felt better to hear her cheerful voice.</p>

<p>Watching his chance, Jerry slipped into the engine
room when he noted that Dr. Klauss was not
there. The German kept mostly to the pilot
house, guiding his marvelous craft under water.
But what was his object, and for what port he was
headed, no one seemed to know. As he went in
to see if there was a chance to speak privately to
Ted Rowland and his mates, Jerry saw the two old
Germans in their cabin, poring over books and
papers, seemingly making intricate calculations.</p>

<p>Jerry saw the three machinists in consultation in
one corner of the engine room. They started at
the sight of him.</p>

<p>“Well, how are things going?” asked the lad,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, well enough, I s’pose,” answered Ted, in
no very cheerful tones. Jerry thought he looked
at him in a peculiar way.</p>

<p>“Say, why don’t you tell him?” suddenly burst
out Bill Burke. “I’m getting sick and tired of this
business! Tell him, and maybe he’ll help us out!”</p>

<p>“That’s what I say!” added Tom Flynn.
“What’s the use of holding back any longer.”</p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked Jerry, quickly, though in
a flash an inkling of the truth came to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lots is up!” exclaimed Ted, vindictively.
“We’re in a submarine run by a lunatic—that’s
what’s up!”</p>

<p>“Have you just found that out?” asked Jerry,
realizing that now was the time to strike for
liberty.</p>

<p>“No, we’ve suspected it for some time,” said
Bill. “But since you folks came aboard he’s got
worse.”</p>

<p>“And now it’s the limit!” added Tom Flynn.</p>

<p>“Why?” Jerry asked.</p>

<p>“He’s just given orders,” went on Ted, “that
he’s going to test this boat to the limit. He says
he’s going to try to get to the bottom of the sea
in a place where it’s two miles, or more, deep, and
he’s going to see how long he can go without refilling
the air tanks. We’ve got orders to hold on
until something busts, and if I had my way something
would bust right soon—and it would be crazy
Dr. Klauss, too!”</p>

<p>“Hush!” warned Bill.</p>

<p>“I don’t care if he does hear me!” went on
Ted. “I’m sick and tired of him!” and he tossed
a monkey wrench down with a bang. “I say let’s
take these boys and their friends into our plan.”</p>

<p>“What plan is that?” asked Jerry, hopefully,
though he could almost guess, now.</p>

<p>“A plan to take possession of this boat, run her
back to America and then get off!” cried Bill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
“We’re tired of being cooped up here with a lunatic.
No telling what he may do! Why, this boat
will never stand the pressure at two miles. And
as for that air test—well, I don’t want to go
through it.”</p>

<p>“Nor do we!” cried Jerry, quickly. “Listen!
I came in here to sound you, and see if you would
join with us in the very same sort of plan. Dr.
Klauss has threatened that we shall never see our
homes again. He is going to maroon us on a desert
island. He hates Americans—he hates you—his
brother was shot as a spy in the Spanish-American
War and he says he’s going to blow up our
navy!”</p>

<p>“Does he!” cried Ted. “Then he sure is
crazy, and I’ll do all I can to put him in irons!
Blow up our navy; eh? What do you think of
that, fellows?”</p>

<p>“That’s the limit!” cried Bill. Though the
men had left Uncle Sam’s service, it was only temporarily,
and they were still loyal, though working
for a foreigner.</p>

<p>“Then you’re with us?” asked Jerry, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Every time!” cried Ted. “We’ll help you
lock up this crazy captain, and then help you navigate
the ship back home. I guess we can do it.”</p>

<p>“What about those other two Germans?”
asked Bill.</p>

<p>“Just give them some problem to work on—say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
to figure how many drops of water there are in
the ocean, and they’ll keep at that day and night—wouldn’t
even eat if you didn’t make ’em. They
won’t bother us.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Jerry, “we’ll take Dr. Klauss
into custody as soon as possible, and gain possession
of this boat. I think we have a right, under
the circumstances, especially after his latest order
to run us all into such risks.”</p>

<p>“Boy, we’re with you!” cried Ted. “Shake!”
and he held out his hand.</p>

<p>As Jerry clasped it there was a sound behind
them, and they turned to behold Dr. Klauss regarding
them with a strange light in his eyes.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<small>IN CHAINS</small></h2>


<p>The conspirators—they were really that,
though it was a conspiracy to save their own lives—the
conspirators, then, started half-guiltily as
they beheld the form of the insane commander.
Had he overheard their plot?</p>

<p>Jerry gave a quick glance at his allies—the machinists.
He seemed to be saying:</p>

<p>“If he has heard us we must act now. We must
overpower him at once if he tries to attack us.”</p>

<p>Ted Rowland nodded as if he understood, and
for a few seconds they all seemed to be waiting.</p>

<p>It was an awkward moment. Then Dr. Klauss
spoke.</p>

<p>“How are the motors running?” he asked, and
his voice sounded perfectly natural.</p>

<p>“All—all right, sir,” answered Ted, hesitating
slightly. It was evident that Dr. Klauss had not
overheard, or, if he had, he was going to ignore
the matter—for the time being at least—and for
his own purposes.</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that,” he went on. “I want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
try and run at top speed soon, and I am going to
give my ship a most severe test. I spoke to you
before about this,” he said, looking at the other
two machinists, who nodded. Jerry understood.
It meant the taking of the <i>Sonderbaar</i> to a dangerous
depth.</p>

<p>“I see you still hold your interest in my machines,”
said the German commander to Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, I—I came in to see how the engines were
running. I only wish,” went on Jerry, with a
whimsical smile, “that they were running us toward
our homes—instead of away from them.”</p>

<p>“That will do!” cried the commander, harshly.
“You have heard my decision in this matter.
Never speak of it again! I did not ask you to
come aboard my vessel, but since you are here
you must take the consequences. This ends the
subject forever!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no it doesn’t,” said Jerry to himself, and
with a meaning look at Ted and his companions.
“This is only the beginning, Dr. Klauss. We are
going to see our homes again in spite of you.”</p>

<p>“Work the engines up to top speed gradually,”
ordered the commander to the members of the
crew. “See that the bearings do not get hot. And
you, Bill Burke, will look after the ballast tanks.
Make sure there are no leaks, and that the valves
are tight. They may be a bit strained when we go
farther down than we have ever been before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should say they would!” burst out Ted
Rowland. “Look here, Dr. Klauss, I wish you
would give up this plan. Of course you know your
own ship better than we do—and know what she
will stand. But we’re machinists, too, and we
know that the terrible pressure you’ll be sure to
meet with at even a mile in depth, to say nothing
of two, or three, will do serious damage. We may
all lose our lives. We don’t like it, and we wish
you’d give it up!”</p>

<p>“Enough of that!” cried the German, sternly.
“You are under my orders. When you shipped
with me you agreed to obey. I order you to take
this craft to a great depth, that I may test it, and
you will do so. You have no choice. I am in command.”</p>

<p>“But the danger!” cried Tom Flynn.</p>

<p>“Bah! There is no danger!” exclaimed the
insane commander. “You will be as safe at the
bottom of the sea as here. Now remember—this
ends all objections! You will do as I say! I am
going to the pilot house, to run my boat from
there. And I want my every order and signal
obeyed promptly. That will be all.”</p>

<p>He turned abruptly on his heel, and went out.
The men looked after him with anger on their
faces, while Jerry showed not a little fear.</p>

<p>“Well, that settles it!” exclaimed Ted, in a low
voice. “We both gave him a chance to back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
down, and let us out,” he said to the tall lad. “He
refused. Now we’ll take matters into our own
hands, and he’ll have to stand the consequences.
We’re all agreed on that?” and he looked questioningly
at his companions.</p>

<p>“Sure—certainly,” they answered.</p>

<p>“Then you can tell your friends,” went on Ted
to Jerry. “We’ll make the captain a prisoner, and
we’ll be justified in law—if we ever get to where
there are laws again.”</p>

<p>“What about his two German friends?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about them. If we have to we
can secure them too, but all we’ll have to do will
be to lock them in their room, with pencils and
papers, and they’ll start figuring on how long
they’ll be likely to remain there, or how much the
sun weighs, or how long it would take the submarine
to get there. That will dispose of them.
Meanwhile we’ll turn this ship about and sail for
home.”</p>

<p>“And when—when shall we make the—attack?”
asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“As soon as he gives an order to send this boat
any deeper in the ocean,” answered Ted promptly.
“That will be the signal. She is now running as
deep as is safe,” and he glanced at the gage on the
wall of the engine room. “The minute he signals
to fill the ballast tanks more, and send her down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
we’ll attack him in the pilot house. Better go tell
your friends what our plan is,” he concluded to
Jerry.</p>

<p>“I was afraid he had heard us,” spoke the tall
lad. “We had a narrow escape.”</p>

<p>“That’s what we did,” agreed Ted.</p>

<p>The news was received by Ned and Bob with
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I’m glad we’re going to do something besides
sit around this submarine waiting,” commented
Ned.</p>

<p>“And I’d like to try my hand at cooking again,”
confessed Bob, with a sigh. “They won’t let me
in the galley here.”</p>

<p>“Well, that all may be changed in a few hours,”
said Jerry hopefully.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad!” cried Grace, whose face
showed traces of tears. “Then we will see our
friends again, Papa.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my girl! It has been a severe strain on
you, but you’ve borne up well. It was a lucky day
when the boys came aboard.”</p>

<p>Jerry rapidly told of his experience with the
crew, and the decision arrived at. On Mr. Sheldon’s
advice the boys got together a quantity of
stout rope, which was placed in readiness to bind
Dr. Klauss after he should have been subdued.</p>

<p>“We’ll lock him in his own cabin,” went on
Bob’s uncle, “and we’ll have to arrange to stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
guard over him. Maniacs are very tricky, and he
may escape. About his two friends—I think, with
the members of the crew, that they will give no
trouble. Now, who is going to do the actual attacking,
Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we all may have to take a hand,” was the
answer. “But I think Miss Grace had better keep
to her own cabin.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” spoke her father gravely.</p>

<p>“And I’m going to stuff cotton in my ears so I
can’t hear it,” said the girl, smiling slightly. “It’s
a terrible thing to do, but it is more to feel that we
may always be prisoners on this fearful ship.”</p>

<p>There was another consultation with the crew.
Meanwhile Dr. Klauss kept to the pilot house and
his two foreign friends had not left the cabin
where they seemed to be always working over
some intricate problem.</p>

<p>It was decided that Ned and Bob, with Mr.
Sheldon, should remain near the pilot house. Jerry
would go to the engine room, and, when the signal
came to send the boat deeper, he and the three
men would rush forward, and attack Dr. Klauss.
They agreed to use no more force than was necessary
to safely bind him.</p>

<p>“Then all we have to do is to wait,” said Jerry,
as he sat down near one of the humming dynamos.</p>

<p>The submarine was running along at about her
usual depth. It was only a question of time when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
her fanatical commander would signal to have her
sent to the bottom.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a buzzing sound from one
of the electric signals. Then, in the glass-fronted
box below it, appeared a certain number.</p>

<p>“That means to go down to the limit!” cried
Ted. “Come on, friends! It’s now or never!”</p>

<p>There was a moment of hesitation and then
Jerry and the three men started. Mr. Sheldon, Bob
and Ned heard them coming, and held themselves
in readiness.</p>

<p>At the end of the lighted corridor they could
all see the big German in the pilot house. He was
manipulating various levers and turning wheels.</p>

<p>“Come on!” said Jerry in a low voice.</p>

<p>As noiselessly as possible they advanced on the
crazed commander. Just as they reached the door
he heard them and turned.</p>

<p>He started, and something in the attitude and
looks of the men and boys must have told Dr.
Klauss what was their intention. He sprang up,
and his hand sought a certain lever.</p>

<p>“Don’t let him reach that!” yelled Ted. Jerry
fairly threw himself on the infuriated man, and
Ned followed. Then Ted and his companions
closed in.</p>

<p>There was a short, sharp fight, and several of
the attackers were knocked down, but they got up
again, and renewed the struggle. Dr. Klauss was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
very strong, and his madness added to it, but four
men and three boys were more than a match for
him, especially in such contracted quarters.</p>

<p>In a few seconds the maniac, panting and disheveled,
as indeed they all were, was held by many
hands.</p>

<p>“The ropes!” called Jerry, and Mr. Sheldon
passed them in.</p>

<p>“They’ll do temporarily,” said Ted Rowland,
“but we’ll have to use chains. That’s the only
thing that will hold him. He’ll break these ropes.
There are some chains in the engine room.”</p>

<p>“What—what does this mean?” gasped the enraged
commander. “Unbind me at once! You
shall pay dearly for this outrage! Help!” he
called, and then, adding something in a foreign
tongue he struggled with all his might to break his
bonds.</p>

<p>The ropes strained and creaked, and Ted at
once sent for the chains. These were placed about
the unfortunate doctor, and, just as they were
made secure, and he had been lifted up to be carried
to his cabin, the two old Germans came running
from their rooms. They were greatly excited.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>ENTANGLED</small></h2>


<p>Dr. Klauss, seeing his two friends, called to
them something in the language he and they used
between them. It seemed to be an appeal for
help.</p>

<p>“Look out for them!” cried Mr. Sheldon, who
had gone on ahead. He had an iron bar for a
weapon.</p>

<p>“Don’t you two interfere!” yelled Ted. “If
you do it will be worse for you.”</p>

<p>“What is it; we don’t understand,” said one of
the men in German.</p>

<p>“We have had to subdue Dr. Klauss,” answered
Jerry, who could manage to speak a little of the
language of the Fatherland. “He has threatened
to take us down to the bottom of the sea at a depth
that would kill us all.</p>

<p>“We are doing this as a precautionary measure,”
went on Jerry, struggling with the German
language. “We intend to turn the ship about, and
land ourselves. Then we will give Dr. Klauss his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
liberty, and he can do as he pleases. But we will
not let you interfere with our plans now!”</p>

<p>Jerry’s stand was determined.</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Mr. Sheldon, who had understood
part of the talk. “That’s the way to handle
them!”</p>

<p>Dr. Klauss, still struggling somewhat in the
binding chains, shouted something in that strange
tongue. The two elderly Germans seemed to hesitate,
and Jerry feared they might try to effect a
rescue, though he had little doubt of the ability of
himself and the others to overpower them.</p>

<p>“Don’t try anything rash!” Jerry shouted.
“We intend no harm to Dr. Klauss. We are only
anxious to save ourselves. It will be best for you
to do nothing.”</p>

<p>The old men appeared to think so, too. They
talked between themselves in low voices and then
spoke to the commander in the secret language.
What they said appeared to displease the fanatic,
but his entreaties were in vain.</p>

<p>“First class in arithmetic!” called Ted, in grim
humor, and this seemed to settle it. The old men
went back to their cabin and when the party passed
it, carrying the captive commander, they were
again bent over their papers, calculating, in all
probability, the weight of the salt in the ocean.</p>

<p>“Well, so far so good!” Jerry exclaimed in relief,
as they deposited Dr. Klauss in his cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“I order you to release me! This is an outrage!”
cried the insane man. “You shall all be
punished for this.”</p>

<p>“We deeply regret the necessity for it,” said
Mr. Sheldon courteously, for, after all, Dr. Klauss
had really saved their lives. “We are only doing
this,” Bob’s uncle went on, “to protect ourselves.
If you would agree to set us ashore, or on some
vessel that would take us to America——”</p>

<p>“No—no! You must not go!” screamed the
commander wildly.</p>

<p>“Then we cannot release you,” said Mr. Sheldon
firmly. “But understand, we mean you no
harm, and as soon as we have landed we will restore
your liberty—or allow your friends to do it
for us. Then you may do as you please with your
boat!”</p>

<p>Dr. Klauss struggled as only a madman can, but
the chains were too strong. He could not escape.
The successful plotters placed their captive in as
comfortable a position as possible, securing him in
such a manner that he could move about. But the
chains were locked on him, and arrangements were
made to stand watch-and-watch outside his cabin
door.</p>

<p>“Now!” cried Ned, when this had been done,
“the next thing to do is to see about getting back
home. Whereabouts are we, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Somewhere in mid-Atlantic, about three hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
feet down,” announced Ted. “We can soon
go up, and take an observation.”</p>

<p>“Go up!” cried Professor Snodgrass, who had
taken no part in the capture and subduing of Dr.
Klauss. “Oh, I had hopes, before this voyage
ended, that I could get my crab specimens from the
bottom of the sea. Would it not be safe to go
down just once? I should like to put on a diving
dress and see if I could not get what I want.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we could do that,” agreed
Jerry slowly. “Now that we are in possession of
the ship we can do as we please, within certain
limits.”</p>

<p>“But are you sure that if once you get on the
bottom of the ocean you can raise the craft again?”
asked Mr. Sheldon, anxiously. “I don’t begrudge
the professor a chance to get his specimens, but we
must take no chances. Our condition has been
desperate enough. Now we have an opportunity
to get back home, and we must not let it slip.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we can get up again, easily enough,” said
Ted Rowland. “I’ll guarantee that. With a free
hand my mates and I can navigate this boat all
right. We’ll have to get out the charts and maps,
though. Dr. Klauss always kept them to himself.
Then I can take an observation, work out our position,
and we’ll know where we are—in which
direction to sail. I guess it will be safe to get your
crabs, Professor Snodgrass.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good!” cried the scientist. “You do not know
how happy you have made me. Let us go down
at once, and I will get into one of the diving suits.”</p>

<p>“And so will I!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“What! Are you going to take a chance?”
asked Bob.</p>

<p>“It isn’t much of a risk,” declared the tall lad.
“I watched Dr. Klauss do it.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll try it, too,” decided Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s first find a place where the bottom
is not too far down,” suggested Mr. Sheldon, with
a smile. “Then after the professor gets his crabs
we will start for home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how glad I will be!” cried Grace, who,
now that the struggle was over, had joined her
father. “Oh, to be safe ashore once again!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it will seem good,” agreed Jerry. “I only
wish we could arrange to keep this boat, though.”</p>

<p>“We sure could have good times in her,” added
Ned. “I wonder if we couldn’t go back, and pick
up our <i>Comet</i> on the way?”</p>

<p>“The <i>Comet</i> must have sunk long ago,” declared
Bob. “But we might rescue that old
sailor.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I fancy he has, by this time, been picked
up and towed to port,” put in Jerry. “Well, shall
we go down?”</p>

<p>“First go up, and renew our air supply,” suggested
Ted. “We can’t have too much of that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Then we’ll work out our observations, and decide
where we are.”</p>

<p>This was voted a good plan, and in a short time,
under the manipulation of the boys and the members
of the crew, the <i>Sonderbaar</i> was tossing about
on the sun-lit waves. She was in the midst of a
watery waste, no other craft being in sight.</p>

<p>While the air tanks were being filled, Ted Rowland
worked out their position. They were about
a thousand miles from the coast of America, and
not far from the Bermuda Islands.</p>

<p>“Not so bad,” announced Ted. “We will soon
be home now.”</p>

<p>“But not before I get my crabs,” stipulated the
professor. “Can we go down here?”</p>

<p>“It is too deep just at this point,” said Ted, as
he consulted a chart obtained from the pilot house.
“But about fifty miles from here there is a bank
that is only about four hundred feet down. We
can safely make that, I think.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dr. Klauss had seemed to accept his
fate with resignation. He remained quietly in his
cabin, and his two foreign friends were in theirs.</p>

<p>The deck hatch of the <i>Sonderbaar</i> was closed,
and she sank below the surface. She was then
headed for the comparatively shallow part of the
ocean, and speeded up.</p>

<p>“We can run as well as if Dr. Klauss were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
here,” said Ned, who was allowed to attend to
one of the motors.</p>

<p>“Yes, your experience in your motorship comes
in well,” observed Ted. The boys were beginning
to be delighted with their experience on the submarine,
now that there was a chance to escape and
get home.</p>

<p>In due time they reached the place where it was
decided to descend to the bottom of the sea, and in
a little while the <i>Sonderbaar</i> was resting on the
white sand. About her swam big and little fishes—all
curious about this new monster of the deep.</p>

<p>Jerry and the professor decided to go out together
in diving suits, and later, if he wished, Ned
could take a turn. No one else seemed to want to.</p>

<p>The diving suits were soon brought out and
Jerry and the scientist, donning them, shut themselves
up in the water chamber. Everything went
along without a hitch, and a few minutes later the
heavy steel door swung open, and the two could
step out on the ocean bed.</p>

<p>It was a novel sensation, and Jerry enjoyed it to
the utmost, although there was a spice of danger
to the adventure. He could not help wondering
what would happen should an accident take place,
or if the <i>Sonderbaar</i> should suddenly go off and
leave them.</p>

<p>But he put these thoughts out of his mind, and
followed the professor. They had their lanterns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and they could look through the glass windows,
and see their friends in the cabin, waving their
hands. Of course Jerry and the professor could
not talk to each other, but there was no need.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass lost no time in looking for
his crab specimens. At first he was not successful,
though he did find some rare shellfish which gave
him manifest delight. Then he came close to
where Jerry was standing on the bed of the ocean,
looking at a great fish, of an unknown species, that
was eyeing the intruders as if in doubt what to do.</p>

<p>The professor stooped down and picked up
something. He held it so Jerry could see, and the
lad beheld a large crab, comfortably established
in the vacant shell of some other creature. The
professor had found what he wanted—a hermit
crab.</p>

<p>“I guess he wishes he could talk now,” thought
Jerry. “He sure will make up for it, though, when
we get on board again. Well, I’m glad he’s found
it. I don’t fancy staying down here too long,
though it certainly is a wonderful thing to have
done.”</p>

<p>The professor walked on a little farther, finding
more specimens which he placed in a net he
had brought along for the purpose. Jerry kept
pace with him.</p>

<p>Suddenly the lad saw what seemed to be a dark
rope dart out, and encircle the professor’s waist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
The scientist turned about, and Jerry could see
that he was surprised. Then another rope was
entwined about Professor Snodgrass. Quickly the
scientist pulled out the long, keen knife with which
the diving suit was equipped, but, before he could
use it Jerry saw a third rope-like appendage whip
itself about the professor’s arm.</p>

<p>Then Jerry understood. Professor Snodgrass
had been attacked by a giant octopus. With a cry
of horror which almost deafened him, reflected
back as it was from the sides of his copper helmet,
Jerry strode to the rescue of his companion. But
before he had taken two steps he felt the giant
arms about himself also.</p>

<p>He and Professor Snodgrass were entangled in
living ropes at the bottom of the sea!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a><br />
<small>THE ESCAPE</small></h2>


<p>Jerry felt the horrid arm of the creature of
the deep squeezing him tighter and tighter. He
could also note that Professor Snodgrass was in
terrible danger; but, so far, the lad had not a
glimpse of the globular body of the fish itself. He
had no doubt that the octopus was hidden in some
crevice of the rocks behind him and his companion,
and, following its usual method, had reached
out and seized the invaders of its haunts.</p>

<p>Quickly Jerry drew his knife, as he had seen the
professor do, but before he could use it, to slash
through the snake-like tentacle, another was
whipped around him, pinning both his arms to his
sides.</p>

<p>The lantern dropped from his hand, but it was
attached to his waist by a light chain, and did not
go out. The right hand of Professor Snodgrass—that
containing the knife—was the only one that
had been caught by the creature. His other was
free, and yet not free, for it held the lantern and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the net into which the sea specimens had been
put.</p>

<p><a href="#image04">Then began a terrible struggle at the bottom of
the sea.</a> The octopus, which they afterward
judged must have been a gigantic specimen, much
larger than usual, began to pull Jerry and the professor
backward. With horror they realized that
they might be drawn into some ocean cave, and
killed, in spite of their strong diving suits, by the
powerful suckers attached to the arms of the creature.
It was only the exceptional size of the beast
that made it formidable, for with a smaller one
either Jerry or the professor could have coped.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 381px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_224">THEN BEGAN A TERRIBLE STRUGGLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA.</a></div>
</div>

<p>Silently the struggle went on, but, fortunately,
not in darkness, for both the submarine electric
lamps still glowed, and now they were within
range of the light that streamed from the glass
windows of the cabin of the <i>Sonderbaar</i>. Someone
had switched them on.</p>

<p>In vain Jerry tried to free his arms. They were
too tightly held, another feeler whipping itself
about him. The remaining tentacles of the creature,
the lad realized, must be clinging to a rock to give
it an anchorage.</p>

<p>Jerry glanced at Professor Snodgrass. The
scientist had now dropped his lantern so that it
dangled at the end of the chain about his waist,
and was making fast to the same chain the net containing
his specimens. Then Jerry had a gleam of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
hope, for he saw the little man transfer the long,
keen knife from his right to his left hand, reaching
for it with the latter.</p>

<p>“Oh, if he can only cut off the arms of the
octopus!” thought Jerry. And yet, as he glanced
down on his chest, and beheld the horrid muscular
object, like some snake, with its spasmodically
working suckers, Jerry had his doubts. Could a
knife cut through in time to save their lives—his
life?</p>

<p>There was danger of the pressure of the arms
working some damage to the compressed air apparatus
carried at the back of the helmet. Already
Jerry felt a choking sensation, as the arms
drew tighter and tighter about him.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass raised the knife to slash
the tentacle of the beast that held him captive.
Then he seemed to hesitate, and Jerry thought he
understood. The diving suit was partly made of
rubber, and the least rent in this, if the knife
should slip, would mean death by drowning.</p>

<p>What could be done?</p>

<p>Tighter and tighter pressed the terrible tentacles.
Closer and closer to the unseen cave the creature
drew its prey. Neither Jerry nor the professor
could turn about, but they knew the horrid
monster of the deep was back of them.</p>

<p>Then the lad glanced toward the submarine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Grouped about the glass cabin window were all
his friends—horror showing on their faces.</p>

<p>“Oh, if they could only do something—use the
electric gun, as Dr. Klauss did on the whale,”
thought Jerry. Then he realized that this would
not be safe. The charge that would kill the octopus
would also kill them.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ned Slade pushed his way close to the
cabin glass. He made a sign to Jerry, and then,
using his fingers to give a message in the deaf and
dumb alphabet (which the chums often practiced)
Ned spelled out this:</p>

<p>“I am coming to save you!”</p>

<p>Jerry’s heart gave a bound. He felt that help
was coming. He called the attention of Professor
Snodgrass to their friends.</p>

<p>The little scientist, however, decided to chance
an attack on the monster’s tentacle. He would
slash it, even though the beast in its throes might
do them serious harm. Jerry realized that he could
not stand it much longer. He felt as though he
were being squeezed to death.</p>

<p>Again he looked toward the glass window, and
saw Ned, with a hopeful gesture, leaving it, accompanied
by two of the machinists.</p>

<p>“He must be going to put on a diving suit and
come out here!” thought Jerry. “Good old Ned!
But he’d better hurry!”</p>

<p>It seemed an hour, but really it was not more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
than two minutes before Jerry felt behind him a
commotion in the water that told of a change in
the situation. He could not turn to see what it
was. The pressure of the tentacles of the octopus
had increased to what was an almost unendurable
point, and then the arms seemed suddenly to relax.
There was a swirl in the water, and Jerry felt himself
grasped in friendly arms. He turned to see
Ned gazing at him through the glass windows of
the helmet, and another glance showed Ted Rowland
helping to pull off the clinging suckers from
Professor Snodgrass.</p>

<p>The two had come to the rescue, and on the bottom
of the sea had advanced upon the octopus in
its lair, stabbing it to death with long, spear-like
knives. Jerry and the professor had been saved.</p>

<p>Little time was lost in getting back to the side
of the submarine, the water being stained with the
blood of the octopus so that it could not be seen
clearly.</p>

<p>But Ned, who, with the machinist, had had a
glimpse of the creature before attacking it, said
it was a monster in size, and, as Jerry had feared,
had been pulling him and the professor backward
into a crevice between the rocks.</p>

<p>Two at a time the party entered the water-gate
in the side of the <i>Sonderbaar</i>, and soon they were
safely within. The others crowded about the rescued
ones as the diving suits were taken off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, what an awful experience for you!” cried
Grace, while Bob grasped his chum’s hand in a
manner that meant much.</p>

<p>“Yes, it wasn’t very pleasant,” agreed the tall
lad.</p>

<p>“But I got my specimens,” said the professor
proudly when he could get his breath, for he was
well-nigh exhausted, as was his companion.</p>

<p>“And now that you have been successful, let us
go up and start for home,” suggested Mr. Sheldon.
“I am sure we have had enough under-water
horrors.”</p>

<p>There was no dissent from this, and in a little
while the <i>Sonderbaar</i> began to ascend. Up and
up she went, until once more she rested on the
waves in the bright sunlight.</p>

<p>Then a course was laid that would take them
back to Boston. It was decided not to cruise about
to try to find any possible parts of the wrecked
<i>Comet</i>, and as for picking up the lone sailor on the
<i>Hassen</i>, it was agreed that he must have been rescued
by this time.</p>

<p>“We’ll head for home!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“And what will we do with Dr. Klauss?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“I don’t care what happens to him, once we are
safe,” answered the tall lad.</p>

<p>Her tanks filled with plenty of fresh, compressed
air, the submarine was again sent down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
as they decided to travel under water. She was
sunk to a depth of about three hundred feet, and
her engines started at full speed.</p>

<p>“And now let’s have something to eat,” cried
Bob, a little later. “We haven’t had a good meal—that
is, one where we didn’t have to worry—in
some time.”</p>

<p>“Right you are, Chunky!” cried Ned, slapping
him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>They were all at the table, save the two Germans,
who said they preferred to dine in their
cabin, and the automatic steering apparatus had
been set so that no one need be in the pilot house
for the time being.</p>

<p>Suddenly the craft seemed to pitch forward.
She assumed a sloping attitude, her nose pointed
downward, at a steep angle.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“Something’s wrong,” shouted Ned.</p>

<p>Ted Rowland hurried to the corridor and
looked into the pilot house. The door was open,
and there, standing before the levers and switchboard,
was Dr. Klauss!</p>

<p>“He has escaped!” cried the engineer. “He’s
in possession of the boat again! Quick, boys, or
he’ll send us to the bottom where we can’t get
up!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a><br />
<small>THE LONELY ISLAND</small></h2>


<p>Only an instant was needed for the full meaning
of this information to sink into the minds of
all. Jerry and his chums rushed into the corridor
after Ted.</p>

<p>“We must recapture him!” cried Mr. Sheldon.
“He is capable of doing all some terrible harm
after what we did to him!”</p>

<p>“How did he get out of the chains?” asked
Bob.</p>

<p>“No time to think of that now!” panted Ned.
“The question is how to get him back in them
again. Come on, fellows!”</p>

<p>“Grace, go to your stateroom!” commanded
her father, quickly. “There may be some danger——”</p>

<p>“I’ll look after her,” volunteered Professor
Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“All right,” assented Bob’s uncle. They knew
they would hardly need Professor Snodgrass’s assistance
in the coming struggle, and it was better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
to have someone at hand to look after Grace, in
case the two German friends of Dr. Klauss should
take it into their heads to render him aid in his
mad project.</p>

<p>All this time (comparatively short, though it
may seem long in the telling) the <i>Sonderbaar</i> was
behaving in a peculiar manner. She was rolling,
pitching and tossing, though she continued to sink
toward the bottom of the sea on a long slant.</p>

<p>“What’s his game?” queried Jerry.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to stop it, whatever it is,” answered
Ted.</p>

<p>They made a rush toward the pilot house, while
Professor Snodgrass closed the door of the cabin
containing himself and Grace.</p>

<p>Dr. Klauss, who was still busy manipulating the
various levers before him, turned at the sound of
rushing feet. A sneer showed around his cruel
mouth, and he laughed.</p>

<p>“Ha!” he cried. “You thought you had me
a prisoner! But I fooled you! Now who is master?
I am going to put an end to all of you. Had
you let me alone, you would, at worst, have been
but captives. Now you shall all die!”</p>

<p>“Not if we know it!” cried Jerry, bravely.</p>

<p>“Rush him!” yelled Ned, and tragic as the situation
was, he could not, for the life of him, help
thinking that it was like an impending scrimmage
on the football field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>But the refugees were not destined to capture
the insane commander as easily as they had before.
With a mocking laugh Dr. Klauss shoved over a
lever and the steel sliding door of the pilot house
closed. It was locked from within.</p>

<p>“There!” cried Ted. “Why didn’t I think
he’d do that? I should have wedged that door
open. Now we can’t get at him!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there any way of opening the door from
the outside?” asked Jerry, pausing, crestfallen,
with his companions.</p>

<p>“No, he can lock it securely from within,” answered
Bill Burke.</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t stop him now!” exclaimed
Tom Flynn. “We’ll have to batter it down. That
maniac will send us all to the bottom and keep us
there!”</p>

<p>Indeed there was grave danger of this. The
submarine, under the influence of the mad commander,
was plunging downward at a terrific rate.</p>

<p>“Batter down the door!” cried Tom. “I’ll
get a sledge hammer——”</p>

<p>“No!” interrupted Jerry. “We might damage
the ship, or spring the plates and cause a leak.
Isn’t there any other way?”</p>

<p>“Stop the motors!” cried Ned. “We can do
that from the engine room and then he can’t do
us any harm. Disconnect them from the pilot
house control.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s it!” agreed Ted. “Come on, boys!”</p>

<p>The submarine was now rolling at a sickening
angle. It was as though she was in the trough of
the sea, on top, but the boys knew she was several
hundred feet down. A glance at an auxiliary
depth gage told them that.</p>

<p>“It’s he who is doing it!” cried Ted. “He’s
crazy—he doesn’t know what he’s doing. He’s
filling the ballast tanks unequally, and she’s got a
bad list to starboard. And he’s set the port and
starboard planes at different angles, which makes
her go down this way. Oh, he’s surely crazy!
He’ll kill us all!”</p>

<p>White-faced they stared at one another. It
seemed that the end had come.</p>

<p>Suddenly they all became aware of a peculiar
odor—a choking, suffocating smell, while there
seemed to be floating about them a vapor of greenish-yellow
tint. They began to gasp for breath.</p>

<p>“What—what is it?” panted Bob. “I—I can’t
breathe!”</p>

<p>“None of us will in a few minutes!” choked
Jerry. “It’s chlorine gas! Some sea water must
have gotten into the sulphuric acid of the storage
battery solution. That will make chlorine!”</p>

<p>“That—that’s right, lad!” gasped Ted.
“That’s what happened. I’ve smelled it before
when we had an accident on board Uncle Sam’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
submarines. There’s a leak near the storage
tanks!”</p>

<p>“What—what can be done?” queried Mr.
Sheldon. “That gas will soon be deadly.”</p>

<p>“It’s getting worse,” spoke Ned in a low voice.
Bob, whose stoutness made him more susceptible
to the effects of the chlorine gas, was staggering
about weakly.</p>

<p>“Quick!” cried Jerry. “We must stop the
motors, and then see if we can’t force the ship to
the surface. Fresh air is the only thing that will
save us now. We must get rid of the chlorine
gas!”</p>

<p>Staggering they made their way to the engine
room. The motors were humming away at top
speed, being controlled and regulated by Dr.
Klauss, shut up in the pilot house. The pointer of
the depth gage showed that the <i>Sonderbaar</i> was
going swiftly down. Already she was nearing a
thousand feet, and as this was close to the margin
of safety there was no telling when the terrific
weight of the water would crush her like an egg
shell.</p>

<p>True, she was strongly built, and might be able
to stand the pressure, but it was a terrible risk that
the madman was taking, and all realized it save
himself.</p>

<p>Weak from the effects of the gas, which constantly
grew thicker, filling the interior of the submarine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
with its sickly, greenish-yellow tint, Jerry
reached up, and pulled out the switch that stopped
the main motor—the one connected with the propellers.
This at once halted the progress of the
craft. But she was still far below the surface.</p>

<p>No sooner, however, had Jerry stopped the motor
than Dr. Klauss, in the pilot house, made an attempt
to start it again, there being an auxiliary arrangement
for doing this.</p>

<p>“The madman!” cried Ted, and reaching for
a hammer with one blow he broke the connection
leading to the pilot house. That rendered it impossible
for Dr. Klauss to operate the motor from
his position.</p>

<p>“Empty the ballast tanks! Get us to the surface!”
cried Mr. Sheldon. “We are suffocating!”</p>

<p>It took but an instant to open the valve that
forced compressed air into the tanks containing the
tons of water. The air forced out the liquid ballast,
and, while the boys and the others watched
eagerly, the needle of the depth gage began moving
backward.</p>

<p>“We’re going up!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Thank heaven for that!” murmured Mr. Sheldon,
earnestly.</p>

<p>“Get up—as high as you can—near the ceiling!”
cried Jerry. “Chlorine is nearly two and a
half times as heavy as air. There may be some
fresh air near the ceiling.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Choking and gasping, they all climbed up on
various parts of the machinery. The air higher
up was better, but even there it was hard to
breathe.</p>

<p>However, the submarine would be at the surface
in a few moments, and none too soon, either.</p>

<p>“I—I hope Grace is all right,” gasped her
father.</p>

<p>“I’ll go tell her to get up as high as she can,”
volunteered Bob.</p>

<p>“Professor Snodgrass will know enough for
that,” declared Jerry. “He knows the smell of
chlorine and how to avoid it. Stay where you
are.”</p>

<p>“Yes, do,” assented Mr. Sheldon. “Take no
unnecessary risks, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Hark!” cried Jerry, motioning for silence.
They heard someone rushing along the steel-floored
corridor leading to the motor room, and
the next instant Dr. Klauss staggered in on them.</p>

<p>“What—what does this mean?” he cried.
“You are interfering with my boat. We are going—to
the—bottom of—the sea!”</p>

<p>His voice trailed off into nothingness, and he
fell unconscious on the floor.</p>

<p>“The chlorine!” said Ted. “That did it!
We’ll be out of it in another minute, though.”</p>

<p>Up shot the <i>Sonderbaar</i>. They could all tell
when she reached the surface and bounded out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
into the open sea. In an instant Jerry had pulled
the lever that removed the hatch cover. In rushed
the fresh air, quickly reviving the sufferers. But
Dr. Klauss still lay in a faint on the floor of the
motor room.</p>

<p>“We must get him on deck,” said Jerry. “We
can’t let him die, even if he is a maniac and sought
our lives.”</p>

<p>It was hard work, but they managed to get the
unconscious form up the hatchway. Mr. Sheldon
quickly ascertained that Grace and Professor
Snodgrass, though suffering, were safe.</p>

<p>As Jerry and his chums lifted the limp form
of the insane commander out into the open, they
gave a cry of surprise. For there, directly before
them, and so close to the submarine that a few
yards would have rammed her into it, lay a lonely
island—an island in mid-ocean.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a><br />
<small>THE END OF DR. KLAUSS</small></h2>


<p>They all rubbed their eyes, scarcely believing
what they saw. They had been traveling along
beneath the dark ocean, unaware that they were
approaching land, and they had suddenly come
upon the island.</p>

<p>“We—we might have run into it, and smashed
all to pieces,” spoke Ned, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“No, the detectors would have given us warning
in time,” replied Bob. “They probably did,
but we were so busy over other matters that we
didn’t notice them. I wonder what place this is?”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to look it up on the maps,” said
Jerry. “Just now we’ll have to attend to Dr.
Klauss. He seems in a bad way.”</p>

<p>Indeed the poor, mad commander appeared to
be very ill. Probably he had remained in the
small pilot house until it had been almost filled
with the chlorine fumes, and had then rushed out.</p>

<p>But gradually, as the fresh air entered his
lungs, and dispelled the poison, his eyelids fluttered
and his breathing became stronger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s coming around all right,” said Ned,
with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“What about those other two old men?” asked
Mr. Sheldon. “We ought to see to them.”</p>

<p>They were found to be nearly overcome, and
were helped out on deck. There they, too, were
revived.</p>

<p>“It was a close call,” said Jerry, solemnly, as
he helped prop up Dr. Klauss, who had not yet
fully recovered consciousness. “We must see
how he escaped, and whether that water leak is a
bad one. We may have to stay on this island for
a time.”</p>

<p>“It looks an interesting and romantic place to
stay,” spoke Grace Sheldon. “Isn’t it beautiful!”</p>

<p>It was a semi-tropical island of great charm, but
the coast, of hard sand, with a heavy surf, made a
landing—at least at the spot where the submarine
was—out of the question.</p>

<p>A hurried examination of the interior of the
craft showed that some sea water had leaked into
the storage batteries from a sea cock, opened
probably by Dr. Klauss in his mad intention of
putting an end to his companions. The cock was
closed, and no more water came in. The breaking
of the connection between the engine room
and the pilot house could easily be repaired.</p>

<p>“Now the question is, what are we going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
do?” spoke Mr. Sheldon, when it was safe to
again venture into the interior of the ship.</p>

<p>“Go home, by all means,” answered Jerry.</p>

<p>“And we’ll take good care that he doesn’t escape
again!” added Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, we didn’t think it was necessary to stand
guard over his door in the daytime,” said Jerry.
“That’s how he got away without being detected.
He must have filed off his chains.”</p>

<p>This was afterward ascertained to be the case.
The madman had managed to conceal a file about
him, and though it seemed impossible of performance,
had managed to cut his links.</p>

<p>“I guess he’ll be so weak for a while that he
won’t have to be bound very strongly,” observed
Bob.</p>

<p>“We’ll take no chances,” decided Jerry. “As
soon as he recovers fully we’ll take him below.”</p>

<p>But this was never destined to be done.</p>

<p>Dr. Klauss suddenly leaped to his feet, and
rushed to the edge of the deck. Raising his hands
high above his head he cried out:</p>

<p>“I defy you all!” And then, before anyone
could prevent him, plunged overboard.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow!” cried Mr. Sheldon. “We
must save him!”</p>

<p>But there was no way. No small boat was
available, and it would have been folly for anyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
to have jumped into the sea to try to save a
maniac.</p>

<p>But Dr. Klauss had no intention of ending his
life, it seemed. He disappeared under water for
a few seconds, and then was seen to be swimming
for the island.</p>

<p>They watched him make his perilous way
through the surf to the beach. He seemed strong,
even after his trying experience.</p>

<p>Reaching shore, the madman stood up, and
shook his fist at those on the deck of the submarine.
Then the unfortunate man rushed into the
dense growth that came down close to the water’s
edge.</p>

<p>And that was the end of Dr. Klauss. The boys
and their friends never saw him again.</p>

<p>“What—what in the world did he do that
for?” asked Ned, in puzzled tones.</p>

<p>“He’s insane—he doesn’t know what he is doing,”
declared Mr. Sheldon. “Poor man!”</p>

<p>“Those two Germans! We must get them up
here and have them call to him!” cried Jerry.
“We’ll have them tell him we will treat him as
kindly as he will let us. All we ask is to be allowed
to go home. Then he can do as he likes
with his boat. We must get them up here and
have them call to him in that queer language they
use.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a><br />
<small>HOMEWARD BOUND</small></h2>


<p>Trembling, blinking in the strong light, which
must have hurt their eyes after spending so much
time in the dimness of their cabins, the two old
Germans were again summoned to the deck. Jerry
gently explained to them what had happened. The
old men seemed greatly startled, and spoke rapidly
together in their strange language. Then, at
Jerry’s request, they called in the direction of the
island.</p>

<p>There was no response. A megaphone was
made of some cardboard, and that was given to
them. But though they shouted again and again
the name of the unfortunate commander, adding
what was assumed to be assurances that he would
be well cared for, there was no answer.</p>

<p>“I guess he doesn’t want to come back,” remarked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“But what are we to do?” asked Ned. “This
is his boat and——”</p>

<p>“It’s going to be ours long enough for us to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
get back to Boston,” declared Jerry, firmly.
“Then Dr. Klauss can claim it—if he likes.”</p>

<p>“I almost wish we could keep it,” sighed Ned.
“I’m beginning to like this under-water travel.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to go off and leave him on the
island?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“What else can we do?” responded his tall
chum. “He won’t come when we call. And, as
a matter of fact, it looks as though one could
live on that island for some time. There is plenty
of fruit, and probably birds he can snare. Besides,
he can make some sort of a signal, and a passing
ship will take him off. We owe it to ourselves,
and to our friends and families, not to stay here
any longer than we have to.”</p>

<p>“I think that is so,” assented Mr. Sheldon,
after some thought.</p>

<p>They explained matters to the old Germans,
who agreed that Dr. Klauss was not entitled to
further consideration. On their part, they said,
they had had enough of him, and wanted to go
back to their Fatherland. They related briefly
that they had been fellow scientific workers with
Dr. Klauss, who had asked them to make the submarine
trip with him to get valuable data. But
they had had enough.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll start for home!” decided Jerry.</p>

<p>They remained at the surface for some hours,
to allow a few repairs to be made, to get rid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the last of the chlorine gas, and with the faint
hope that Dr. Klauss might consent to be rescued.
But he did not show himself. Everything was in
readiness for the start.</p>

<p>Slowly the <i>Sonderbaar</i>, with her crazed commander
absent, sank beneath the waves.</p>

<p>“Homeward bound!” exclaimed Jerry with a
sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“And I’m going to cook a dandy meal!” cried
Bob, whereat the others laughed. It was really
the first meal they expected to eat with calm
minds, for even with Dr. Klauss in chains there
was a constant worry. Now he was gone.</p>

<p>“I say, Uncle Nelson, can’t you tell us that
secret now?” asked Bob that evening, when they
were speeding homeward a short distance below
the surface. “What was it you were bringing
from Germany?”</p>

<p>Mr. Sheldon opened a case that he took from
his pocket. There was a flash of light, and he
held up to view a magnificent diamond necklace.</p>

<p>“This!” exclaimed Bob’s uncle. “It is an heirloom
that our family has long been trying to get.
It has been stolen several times, and there was a
legal tangle as to the real owner. Finally I came
into possession of facts that proved my right to
it—or, rather the right of myself and your
mother, Bob, and I went to Germany to prosecute
the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>“The odd part of it was that a German family
also claimed the necklace, and, had the case gone
against me, Dr. Klauss would have had a share in
these jewels.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Klauss!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes. And when I won the suit, and the necklace
was awarded to me, the doctor vowed to get
it back. He did not know that I actually had it,
being only told that it had gone to an American.
That is why I did not want to mention it while
he was aboard. He would have had a double
reason for hating me—and all of us. But it is
safe now, and I hope soon to be at home with this
fortune in diamonds.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s one mystery cleared up,” remarked
Bob, while, Grace, with shining eyes, tried
on the gorgeous necklace.</p>

<p>“Yes, and if we could get back our <i>Comet</i>, and
rescue the old sailor on the <i>Hassen</i>, we’d clear
up the other two,” spoke Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m afraid we’ll have to build another
<i>Comet</i>,” came from Jerry.</p>

<p>I will not tire you with a description of the
voyage home. Sufficient to say that it was made,
without accident, though once, when in deep water,
a gigantic shark tried to ram the boat. But it was
killed with the electric bomb gun, as the whale
had been.</p>

<p>The boys and the three machinists were able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
run the submarine to their entire satisfaction.
After the first few days Jerry and his chums ran
it alone, to get the experience. They also halted
once, went to the bottom, and donned diving suits,
for the professor wanted to get a few more specimens.
He secured some rare ones.</p>

<p>“Oh, this has been a most fortunate trip for
me!” he cried, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>And finally the <i>Sonderbaar</i> entered Boston
Harbor, creating no end of excitement. Great
crowds watched her, and when her story was
known the excitement increased. The boys were
overwhelmed by reporters.</p>

<p>“But before we tell anything let them tell us
if the old sailor was saved, and whether our airship
was picked up,” stipulated Jerry.</p>

<p>“I can tell you about that,” volunteered an old
reporter. “I had the story of both. Your airship
was picked up, badly damaged, but in the
main intact. Everyone supposed you were all
drowned.”</p>

<p>“No wonder!” cried Bob. “We must send
off telegrams at once to our folks.”</p>

<p>After this was done, and the safety of Mr.
Sheldon and Grace told of to Bob’s mother, the
newspaper men again begged for particulars of
the remarkable voyage.</p>

<p>“First tell us—was that old sailor saved?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“You mean the one on the <i>Hassen</i>?” queried
a reporter. “He was—a few days after you left
him. He was picked up, the vessel towed to this
harbor, and he got big salvage money. Most of
the passengers and crew were also saved.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Jerry. “Now give ’em our
yarn, boys.”</p>

<p>And that it was a “yarn” well worth telling
may well be believed. Columns of it were printed.</p>

<p>“Oh! what a time we’ve had!” cried Jerry,
when he and his chums finally reached home, and
were received by their tearful parents, who had
almost given up hope.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was tough part of the time, but I’m
not sorry we went through it,” spoke Ned. “I
only wish we could get that submarine—or one
like it—and make other trips.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll be sure to do something more—soon,”
said Bob. “We’ve got to keep active!”</p>

<p>“Indeed—you’ll do nothing more for a long
while!” cried his mother.</p>

<p>But the boys were destined for other adventures,
and what they were will be related in the
next volume of this series, to be called “The
Motor Boys on Road and River; Or, Racing to
Save a Life.”</p>

<p>The two elderly Germans left the submarine
as soon as it was docked in Boston Harbor. They
said they were going back to their native land.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
They had had enough of under-water life, they
declared.</p>

<p>The boys watched the papers eagerly for news
of Dr. Klauss, nor was it long in coming. A small
steamer, passing near the lonely island, stopped
for water. There they found the body of the
unfortunate man. He had died from natural
causes, it seemed—probably from some ailment
that may have affected his mind. He was decently
buried, and a stone cairn marked his grave.</p>

<p>“Poor Dr. Klauss,” murmured Jerry. “I wonder
who will get his submarine now?”</p>

<p>“Why can’t we make a bid for it?” asked Ned,
eagerly. “Probably his family—if he has one—will
be glad to sell it. And it’s over here now.
Let’s see if we can’t buy her.”</p>

<p>“Say, if we only could!” cried Bob, all enthusiasm
now. “I never saw a better place for cooking
meals!”</p>

<p>“Or for having things happen!” added Jerry.
And so, thus planning for more thrilling adventures,
we will take leave of the Motor Boys.</p>
